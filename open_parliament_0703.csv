Status quo or problem / issue being
addressed
Policy and strategy development is based on the Integrated Planning System
(SPI). IPS is the national decision-making key system for defining strategic
directions and resource allocation (the World Bank refers to the Albanian SPI
as one of the best practices in the region). The IPS's main goal is to draft a
strategic, integrated, structural and accountable plan for Albania, including
harmonizing the adaptation of existing planning and monitoring systems within
the new system and reorganizing structures under the new system. IPS aims to
avoid drafting ad hoc policies and strategies, avoid overlapping, and ensure
compliance with financial planning processes.
The IPS institutional framework is further consolidated with the restructuring
of the Prime Minister's Institution and the strengthening of the monitoring and
strategic planning capacities in this institution through the establishment of the
Development and Good Governance Policy Unit at the Department of
Development and Good Governance and the Regulatory Acts Programming
Unit at the Regulatory and Compliance Department.
Information systems are being set up for different components of SPI. Since
2007, the Medium Term Budgeting System (MTBP) is functioning for all line
ministries, while the Government Financial Information System (AFMIS), the
Foreign Assistance Management Information System (EAMIS) and the
Information System for the Integrated Planning System (IPSIS). Regarding the
legislative process and the quality of the legislation, there are efforts to improve
the analysis, plan the measures and their fulfillment. In general, the process of 
24
drafting the legislation is accompanied by insufficient transparency and lack of
stakeholder consultation. In 2014, the Law on Public Consultation of Political
and Legislative Acts was adopted, as well as a new law on the right of
information, for which the necessary measures for full and qualitative
implementation should be taken. In few cases there have been genuine ex ante
and ex post assessments of the consequences of legislation.
Challenges:
Consolidating the framework of the Integrated Planning System remains a
challenge. Moreover, it is necessary to consolidate the capacity of the new
structures related to the functioning as a whole of the entire system
mechanisms. Increasing system efficiency needs to be addressed through its
consolidation.
Establishing information systems for IPS components requires a clear
implementation of business core processes related to policy, budget, and
investment planning. On the other hand, the capacity building of the institutions
involved is necessary
In terms of improving the regulatory system:
➢ Policies aim at strengthening the system of integrated planning, policy
and legislation monitoring, reporting and evaluation, which transforms
government priorities into concrete actions; increasing the
transparency of government's strategic documents and monitoring
them; enhancing the capacity of ministries to develop good policies
and legislation in line with the acquis.
Policies in this sector will also aim at increasing efficiency in strategic planning
and monitoring the performance of implemented policies; establishment of
information systems for public policy and public finance planning systems;
capacity building and improvement of horizontal coordination and cooperation
between ministries, as well as within line ministries; as well as the
establishment of mechanisms for controlling the effectiveness of legislation.

• Implementation of the E-legislation (part of PACEP project)through AKN4AL (Akomanto so for Albania) Standard will result in an integrated and transparent legislative workflow thatimproves access to consolidated laws and parliamentary records. • The review of the decision 49/2017 of the Parliament of Albania ""On the establishment of a mechanism for systematic monitoring of the follow-up and implementation of the recommendations of independent constitutional institutions aims to strengthen the role of the Minister of State for Relations with the Parliament in monitoring the Line Ministries regarding the implementation of the recommendations of independent institutions and to further encourage the use of Online Inter-Institutional Platform.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? • Improvement of the Interoperability between different solutions of the legislative process. • The need to have standard formats to avoid multiplication of formatting work and deviations from drafting rules. • Inability to determine the content of a document at different points in time. • The lack of legislation in an easily accessible format reflecting all amendments up to the present time, otherwise referred to as consolidated version of a law amended several times. • Parliament’s capacities in law making and oversight are low due to a weak system in place in parliament’s administration. • The impartial and evidence-based data and research provision to MPs – although critical for a well-functioning parliament – is missing. • MPs are therefore overly reliant on government analyses to evaluate government laws and policies and are more prone to political polarization of their work. • In terms of parliament’s representation function, there is a big gap between citizens and the parliament. • The input of civil society organizations (CSOs) in the legislative process is limited. • The participation of citizens in decision making is very limited in Albania’s reality. • The lack of responsiveness of public administration bodies according to implementation of recommendations of the independent institutions. 

2. What are the causes of the problem? • Some of the causes of the problems are related to the lack of capacity in the Assembly’s administrative staff. • Outdated technology, especially in the legislative workflow and access to information. • Lack of transparency of the legislative process. • Lack ofa long-term strategic plan for the parliament, accompanied by a corresponding modernized concept of human resource management. • Technological deficiencies of the parliamentary infrastructure in terms of archiving or legislative services. • The existence of a high level of distrust of citizens towards the parliament. • Lack of reliable information on legislative developments through the media and access to decision-making. • The lack of reaction of the state administration bodies against the recommendations of independent institutions 

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? Many practical changes have been made which have reflected a positive feedback According to E-legislation/PACEP project: • The Civic Education Service (SHEQ) is built as part of the Parliamentary Institute (IP), which has a mission to create and implement programs that inform and educate citizens about democracy and governance, as well as encourage citizens to be active in the work of the Assembly. To achieve what it aims, SHEQ implements educational and informative programs and activities, such as: 1) ""Democracy Workshop"" program: 2) ""My point of view"" program; 3) The ""Model of the Albanian Parliament"" program; 4) ""Parliamentary Tours; 5) ""Open doors"", etc. • A Strategic Plan for the Parliament has been drawn up. The Strategic Plan of the Assembly 2020-2025, as the first comprehensive strategic document of the legislative branch of Albania's government, aims, among other things, to modernize law-making and strengthen parliamentary control. • An e-Legislation application has been developed on the phone for MPs • Digitization of past parliamentary data and integration with the e-Legislation system According to the inter-institutional mechanism platform: • The Minister of State for Parliamentary Relations has established a network of coordinators within each ministry in order to support the process of implementing the recommendations of independent institutions. This network is responsible for monitoring progress on the level of implementation and reporting twice a year. • In April 2022, was held the annual meeting, with concrete tasks for the continuation of the reporting process and the improvement of the quality and content of the report. • By order of the Secretary General of the Parliament, a working group has been set up to review the decision 49/2017 of the Parliament of Albania ""On the establishment of a mechanism for systematic monitoring of the follow-up and implementation of the recommendations of independent constitutional institutions"". This working group is composed by members of Monitoring Service Directory in the Parliament, representative form Independent Institution and representative form Ministry of State for Parliamentary Relations. The work of this group is in progress. 

2. What solution are you proposing? • Interoperability: The harmonization of legal document formats through AKNAL will allow interoperability between institutions, data interchange, using common tools, shared templates. • Consolidated legislation: Consolidated legislation will be generated in real time without the need for manual compiling. • Public access: Media, CSOs and the general public will be able to search and find legislation in a compiled format, along with the entire legislative history of each act. • Transparency: The ability to see the entire legislative history of an act will improve transparency of Parliament both internally (among MPs, committees, staff) and externally (towards the public). According to the inter-institutional mechanismplatform: • A very proactive engagement toward a good functioning of the joint mechanism for systematic monitoring of independent institutions’ recommendations and also in fostering the implementation of the recommendations of independent institutions given for executive institutions. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? The project E-legislation results: • Application of AKN4AL XML standard to Albanian parliamentary and other normative documents • Digitalization of past parliamentary documents and archives using AKN4AL and incorporate digital records into e-Legislation framework. The review and improvement of inter-institutional mechanism platform results: • Improvement of the level of implementation of the recommendations of independent institutions given for executive institutions by: Strengthening the role of the Minister of State for Relations with the Parliament in monitoring the Line Ministries regarding the implementation of the recommendations of independent institutions and further encouraging of the use of Online Inter-Institutional Platform.

Milestones | Expected Outputs | Expected Completion Date

Organize e-Legislation awareness and capacity building events. The Project will conduct a series of events including exchanges with focus on e- Legislation for different target audiences, including MPs, Assembly and ministries staff and CSOs/academia. |  The objective will be to gain knowledge from advanced practices and at the same time demonstrate how the e-Legislation system works and how it will benefit different stakeholder groups | S II 2023- S I 2024

Update Parliamentary Administration’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and legal framework to accommodate e- Legislation workflows; The workflow of the parliamentary staff within the legislative department and the committees will need to be updated to accommodate how the legislative documents will be processed using the e-Legislation software. | Incorporating e- Legislation into the overall workflow of the parliamentary staff will be accomplished by preparing SOPs for e-Legislation. Ø The legal framework governing how laws are processed, edited and published, including the Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, will likewise be reviewed to determine if any will be processed using the e-Legislation software. changes will be needed to accommodate the e- Legislation system. | S II 2023- S I 2024",1/1/2023,12/31/2025,Minister of State for Relations with the Parliament,Assembly of Albania,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2024,ND,ND,ND,ND,Yes,ND,ND,ND,ND,1,ND,ND,ND,ND,ND,ND,Modest,1,0,NA,NR,NR,NR,NR,NR,NR,NR,NR,NR,NR,NR,NR,NR,NR,NR,NR,NR,0,0,0,0,1,ND,1,0,0,1,ND,ND,0,ND,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,FALSE,https://opengovpartnership.org/members/albania/commitments/al0097,NA,0,AP_ALB06,7490

AR0094,Argentina,4,16,ARG,Americas,National,1,2019,2022,3,NA,Open Congress Action Plan,Open Congress Action Plan,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address?
So far, there is no institutionalized mechanism for dialogue between both legislative chambers and civil society organizations which allows co-creation of openness initiatives. These policies have been originally developed within the executive branches through the proliferation of open government offices and the implementation of commitments within the frame of the OGP. Based on an Open State approach, Argentina stands out for having engaged the three branches of power in the Third OGP National Action Plan by including commitments of the Judicial and Legislative powers and various oversight institutions. In this sense, the goal is to deepen this practice based on the successful previous experience so that this new commitment presents a more comprehensive approach. This starting point also builds upon lessons learnt from co-created a commitment (No. 11) in the Third Plan. Its implementation was a key process to foster dialogue with organized civil society; as well as to generate new spaces of exchange between the different management areas of both Chambers and with various national, subnational and international government stakeholders. The Argentine Congress grew by 8% in terms of Legislative Transparency since 2016, but is still 9th in the region. Considering the complexities of citizen access to the stages of parliamentary processes, there is a need to institutionalize openness practices, taking into account the particularities of the Legislative Power and its parliamentary cycles. this builds up on acknowledging a baseline in which it is necessary to deepen citizen participation, advance publication of open data, guarantee access to public information, and raise ethical standards in the management of the National Congress. Therefore, the proposal to generate an Open Congress Action Plan, which includes legislators, stakeholders involved in the management of internal processes, organized civil society, academia and the OGP with its co-creation and monitoring methodologies is critical to the consolidation of openness policies in the Argentine Congress.

What is the commitment?
The commitment is to design in a participatory manner and implement an Open Congress Action Plan, in line with the public policy guidelines fostered by the OGP, that brings together a set of commitments undertaken by both chambers of Congress together with CSOs, academia and citizens. The objectives of this commitment are the following:
●        Strengthen and incorporate new practices of government openness within the Congress;
●        Encourage greater dialogue and citizen participation in legislative processes;
●        Promote inter-institutional dialogue between legislators, officials, authorities and employees of both legislative chambers;
●        Include actors from civil society, academia, media and the private sector in the processes of co-creation of parliamentary public policies;
●        Innovate in transparent mechanisms for the dissemination of legislative processes, focused on clear language and public communication of government acts;
●        Promote the adoption of sound ethical standards in legislative processes.
The First Open Congress Action Plan is intended to be a fundamental milestone that institutionalizes a policy of legislative openness, through dialogue and citizen participation in the Argentine Congress.

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem?        
The development of a commitment that foresees to define the process and methodology to design a first Open Congress Action Plan aims to promote the participation of all the stakeholders involved in its implementation. For this reason, opening the previous process as part of a commitment undertaken in the context of the Fourth National Action Plan gains relevance and allows the methodological design of the Open Congress Action Plan to be co-created and agreed upon with all those who will be affected by the process. It also establishes the commitment to meet specific deadlines and attainable goals that allow to set a roadmap for those involved and a sensible work plan to be drawn up considering the times of the legislative process. In summary, this is a commitment that institutionalizes the process of preparing an Open Congress Action Plan with a vision focused on effective, transparent and collaborative participation.

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?         
The commitment is mainly relevant to citizen participation as it generates mechanisms so that diverse voices can be integrated into the process of co-creation of an Open Congress Action Plan. This institutionalizes open government policies in other areas of the State, specifically in the Legislative branch, thereby moving towards an Open State paradigm. In that sense, the proposal for the elaboration of an action plan of the Congress is presented as an opportunity to engage new stakeholders in the co-creation of legislative management policies, promote citizen participation in legislative processes, deepen transparency policies, and promote parliamentary innovation.

Additional information        
This commitment results from the work of both chambers of the Congress, together with a group of civil society organizations.
●        The commitment is presented as a continuity of the progress made by the National Congress in the implementation of openness policies, in line with the commitment number 11 undertaken in the Third OGP National Action Plan through which the open data policies initiated.
●        In the case of the Chamber of Deputies, this commitment acknowledges the work carried out by the Open Parliament Network (which was created by residency Resolution RP No. 951/16), made up of legislative authorities and CSOs, through which concrete actions and areas of periodic dialogue have been agreed upon.
●        This commitment also aims to be inspiring so that these practices of co-creation and joint work with civil society organizations are replicated in the provincial legislatures, thereby promoting the federal debate in the implementation of good legislative practices that have at their core participation, collaboration and transparency.

AR0096,Argentina,4,18,ARG,Americas,National,1,2019,2022,3,NA,Open Congress Action Plan,Design Open Congress action plan,"What is the public problem the commitment will address? The Honorable Senate of the Nation incorporated certain commitments and then implemented various government opening actions during the Third Action Plan National Open Government. This was possible thanks to the unique work of the Power National Executive from 2012 onwards. The Argentine State has been a member of the OGP since that year, which, together with certain practices that promote participation, transparency, access to information and accountability has configured a collaborative work scenario with different state government sectors, non-governmental, civil and political society. It is central for the Senate to retake these joint practices and experiences to establish new commitments based on the deepening of certain policies, the rectification of others and the setting of new objectives. It is extremely necessary that the Senate, as a representative sphere, incorporate mechanisms that make it possible to interpellate various sectors of the citizenry. From such a way of increasing citizen participation in all its processes. It is also imperative to collaboratively design various procedures that make it possible to increase active transparency, improve the publication of open data and the design of technological and administrative procedures that result in an improvement in the guarantee of access to information. As well as the use of interfaces and technological platforms that maximize participation and transparency in the different areas of its management. It is imperative to expand the spaces for participation and add new allies in the process of generating the Senate Open Congress Action Plan of the Nation. In this sense, the participation of actors from civil society, non-governmental public entities (such as sectors academics or research institutes), legislators and legislators that strengthen thus the public policy of participation, transparency, innovation and technology of the Senate of the Nation.

What is the commitment? Design and execute the Open Congress Action Plan in the National Senate. The Plan will incorporate all the commitments assumed by the Congress of the Nation having as its axis the principles of transparency, citizen participation, accountability, technology and innovation established by the OGP for legislative practices of its member countries. The objectives of this commitment are:
• Strengthen and incorporate new practices of government openness in the Senate of the Argentine Nation;
• Promote greater dialogue and citizen participation in legislative processes;
• Promote inter-institutional dialogue between legislators, officials, authorities, workers, both legislative chambers;
• Include civil society actors in policy co-creation processes public parliamentarians;
• Innovate in transparent mechanisms for the dissemination of legislative processes, focused on clear language and public communication of the acts. of government;
• Promote the adoption of sound ethical standards in legislative processes.

How will this contribute to solving the problem? The definition of a methodology that enables the design and application of a Plan
Open Congress Action allows broadening and promoting the participation of various civil society actors. And develop open government tools to deepen the practices of legislative opening. Hence, it is essential for the success of the Plan to incorporate the set of actors that take it forward to the design of its methodology and the establishment of its objectives. The Plan will incorporate goals, objectives and deadlines that can be materialized in the weather. The Plan consists of a commitment that makes it possible to institutionalize certain practices of citizen participation, transparency, incorporation of technology and innovation collaboratively.

How is this commitment relevant to values of OGP? The commitments made seek to open new participatory spaces and improve existing ones in order to achieve greater involvement of civil society in legislative processes. In turn, citizen participation allows feedback in development of public policies and information management, strengthening trust and generating innovative proposals. The implementation of technology tools to certain processes and / or practices participation, access to information and transparency contribute to civil society information in a simple, balanced and objective way to facilitate the solution of community problems, as well as the search for alternatives and opportunities. This enables an improvement in the practices of transparency and access to information. and guarantees the efficient use of public resources.

Additional Information By virtue of the global pandemic caused by Covid-19 and the mandatory measures of Social, Preventive and Mandatory Isolation ordered by the Executive Power National, and as a consequence of which the Legislative Power has issued the pertinent measures to guarantee the safety and health of its workers, the previously established deadlines were impossible to comply with. For this reason, new deadlines are proposed in view of the epidemiological reality and the need to have new practices and technologies that allow connection, participation and transparency in a secure and remote way. This forces to partially redesign the Plan deadlines and the logistics necessary to Address your goals and objectives in an achievable way.

The lack of accessibility to public spaces and services is a problem experienced mainly by people with disabilities and/or reduced mobility. This barrier, although significant in itself, entails other barriers, such as the difficulty in accessing information produced by federal, state or municipal public bodies, which has a negative impact on the participation of this group in activities and initiatives of interest. In terms of access to information, to the flaws in public bodies’ structures, which hinder data search, access and consumption, are added a lack of uniformity and concern regarding the disclosure of information in accessible formats. With regard to people with disabilities, there is also a lack of concern for compliance with legislation, which reinforces an institutional culture that often neglects the importance of accessibility. Although several institutions are currently already engaged with the introduction of assistive technologies in work processes and offer information access mechanisms, such as an interpreter of Libras (Brazilian Sign Language) and language improvement in content production, such as using the hashtag “pracegover” (“fortheblindtosee”), these capabilities still need to be enhanced. Considering the particularities of the Legislative, which is present in all federative entities through its federal, state and municipal bodies, such as the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, the state assemblies and, especially, the thousands of municipal chambers across the country, with their varying structures that reflect geographic and cultural inequalities, solving accessibility problems becomes a substantial challenge. Therefore, this commitment aims to address this issue, with a view to guaranteeing the rights of people with disabilities and promoting accessibility to these important decision-making bodies. In this regard, the commitment aims to seek solutions to the lack of accessible service channels, such as Ombudsman’s Offices and the 0800 phone service, as well as address the need to improve social participation tools (e-Democracy and eCitizenship), in order to enhance the capability of communicating with the general public, particularly with people with disabilities.

What is the commitment? The commitment consists of implementing accessibility actions in three areas: training, communication and technological resources, in order to improve accessibility for people with disabilities and/or reduced mobility in the Legislative, with a focus on training actors and adapting processes and procedures to enhance transparency, social participation and political incidence in meetings, sessions, audiences, seminars, conferences, videoconferences, workshops, courses, lectures and speeches. 

How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? There are ongoing initiatives aimed at promoting accessibility for people with disabilities and/or reduced mobility within the main Legislative bodies, such as the National Congress (Senate and Chamber of Deputies), state assemblies and municipal chambers. These actions, however, need to be expanded, with a view to creating a more robust institutional culture of implementing solutions to current accessibility problems. The following are some of this commitment’s expected results: training/awarenessraising of employees, reduction of behavioral barriers, production of accessible content, formalization of a permanent accessibility committee (CPA) and coordination of public policies with the needs of people with disabilities. These actions aim not only to improve participation mechanisms for people with disabilities in in-person or online events and seek communication accessibility, but also to promote a policy of providing predictable information (in accessible formats) before voting legislative proposals to enable citizens to obtain timely knowledge and implement engagement and coordination strategies regarding matters of interest. To enhance accessibility policies, the recommendation is to establish a channel for sharing best practices related to accessibility and create a “parlametria” interface, which would provide information on legislative proposals in progress at the National Congress. 

Why this commitment is relevant to OGP values? By addressing accessibility issues particularly in terms of the right of access to information – in combination with other initiatives – the commitment takes into account the OGP principles and highlights the importance of including a social group that is often neglected in more universalized discussions. Developed considering the peculiarities of each public that engages with the Legislative, the commitment strengthens specific actions from the perspective of broader values, helping to create mechanisms with a focus on the principles of transparency, social participation and innovation. 

Additional information This commitment involves actions related to SDG 11, in particular its Target 11.7: “By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities.”

Status quo / Issue to be Addressed In general terms, citizens do not find the functions and activities of the different branches of government easy to understand. This complexity makes difficult the interaction between citizens and the government in terms of citizens’ requests and co-creation as well as the follow-up, monitoring and control of public policies. Below are some different issues identified: • Lack of unified criteria for the publication of public information. Currently, information is dispersed, it is not completely clear and there is a lack of access to data. • Lack of information about data generated by each area and inexistence of a protocol established to ease the exchange of such data. While individual efforts are made by Ministries to exploit the data, there is no unified strategy nor coordination between the areas. There is a need to promote the reuse of open data through the participation of several actors in the processes. • The Executive Branch drives different citizen participation stages: virtual, on-site, at public works, etc. There is a need to systematize the information and its indicators to be able to conduct a follow-up, measure the impact in the public policies in an open manner and see the results of these stages. • There is a lack of systematised information in an open format within the Legislative Branch. Likewise, while the Legislature – and the Constitution of the City- promote diverse citizen participation stages, there is no virtual space that systematises the information generated in the Legislature in an open data format, nor an office that centralises citizens’ claims and suggestions or promotes proximity to citizens. • Deficiency in intra-institutional communication of the Judicial Branch. By innovating and making the processes transparent, we will be able to bring them closer to the citizens who normally do not know in detail how Justice works due to its legal technicalities and the limited openness of information on how justice operates.

General objective Make the functions of the three branches of Government more understandable and bring them closer to the citizens, facilitate the follow-up and participation of neighbours in citizen participation stages. Strengthen data openness and generate innovative mechanisms for accountability through the creation of indexes which allow for the assessment of public policies.

Brief description of the initiative The commitment “Openness and Innovation for an Open Government” has different lines of action aimed at improving institutions and their relationship with citizens. These lines of action are: Access to information and assessment – Generate unified publication standards. Elaborate a diagnosis of relevant information related to civil society demand. Create tools and methodologies to assess the public policies on transparency. Open data and reutilisation - The commitment will seek to enhance the open data policy through 3 stages: one internal stage on redefinition of standards and normalisation of criteria; another one aimed at the promotion of use, reuse and openness on request; and another stage for the increasement of published datasets and its displays. Strengthening and follow-up of citizen participation – we will work towards the openness of information on indicators and data about the citizen participation practices carried out by the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. We seek to ease the tracking process to show the public the results of the different processes and practices opened, and promote different participation spaces within the public policies cycle. Open data and participation in the Legislature - Analyse the information generated in the Legislature, systematise it and make it available in a centralised open data platform. Create a centralised office to act as a direct link with citizens, which can serve as a tool to increase transparency and proximity to society. Open Courts - Generate an openness space in the Judicial Branch through an Innovation Laboratory which allows for the co-creation, development and diffusion of open government policies leading to the opening of a new extra- and inter- judicial participation channel.

Describe the way in which this commitment is relevant to strengthen OGP values of transparency, access to information, public accountability, civic participation, and technology and innovation for openness and accountability. The generation of unified standards together with the creation of a diagnosis of relevant information related to civil society demand as well as the creation of assessment tools will strengthen civil society’s capacity to monitor and assess the City’s public policies in terms of transparency. Openness of more data contributes to transparency, access to information and accountability. Furthermore, the promotion of use, the reuse and openness on request promote citizen participation, technology and innovation. The participation initiative will make citizen participation processes more transparent and it will provide feedback since it discloses the results, thus it generates a feedback circle between the government and citizens. The improvement of the access to parliamentary information by facilitating the analysis and electronic access to parliamentary information to all citizens and institutions, will allow for the improvement of performance accountability. In addition to enhancing the civil society’s monitoring capacity, the centralised spaces for access to virtual information and the OAC (Citizen Services Office) will promote the effective participation of citizens in the decision-making processes. The creation of a Judicial Innovation Laboratory will facilitate citizens’ access to legal information, moreover, the establishment of openness practices will contribute to accountability.

BG0090,Bulgaria,4,12,BGR,Europe,National,1,2022,2024,2,Civic participation,Developing a template for sending online petitions to state bodies and its adaption on the official Internet page for sending online petitions to the government and parliament,Development of Online Petition Platform,"What is the public problem being addressed by the measure? The citizens have the constitutional right to submit petitions with requests of public importance to the state bodies. The institutions are obliged to guarantee and create conditions for the citizens to be able to exercise their rights. The development of contemporary public relations requires the implementation of the petition right to also be possible online. Currently there are private unrecognized by the state bodies platforms, which the citizens use to initiate petitions and gather support for them. These platforms don’t guarantee the commitment of the respective state body to get acquainted with the request, there are no rules what actions the respective body will take in case of a given number of collected signatures for a petition. So the lack of conditions set by the institutions for exercising this right makes it an inefficient tool for civil participation. 

What does the measure consist of? The measure consists of the following specific areas of activity: • Creation of a work group by order of the Administration of the Council of Ministers headed by the MEG and with the participation of representatives of the administration of the Council of Ministers, the National Assembly, civil organizations and IT specialists with experience in the development of tools for civil participation, • Analysis and development of a task (specification) with the relevant functionalities necessary to fulfill the objectives of the platform. 46 • Development of a template with the functionalities of the platform to allow its use by various administrations of state bodies at the national and local level. • Adapting the portal template for online petitions to government and parliament • Construction and adoption of uniform rules and security in the procedures for exercising the right to online petitions • Conduct an information campaign to promote the page for submitting online petitions to the government and parliament 

How will the implementation of the measure contribute to solving the problem? Citizens will have access to a secure online petition platform, which is recognized by government authorities as a tool for realizing their constitutional right to send their requests to them and gather additional public support. State bodies will have direct access to citizens' proposals and requests, which they will use as a source for the policies and legislative changes needed and desired by citizens. The platform will guarantee predictability and transparency in the behavior of government bodies when sending an online petition to them. 

How does the measure relate to the values of the initiative? The measure directly affects the increase of citizen participation, as it includes the necessary creation by the state of appropriate conditions for the exercise of the rights of citizens to participate in decision-making.

CL0069,Chile,5,9,CHL,Americas,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Diseño de plataforma integrada e interoperable de gestión e información legislativa,Design integrated legislative information platform,"¿Cuál es la problemática que el compromiso aborda? La información legislativa del Congreso Nacional está distribuida en distintas plataformas o sitios web (Sistema de Información Legislativa (SIL), páginas web (comisiones, asistencia y votaciones, lobby) portal LeyChile, portal asesoría parlamentaria BCN, portal Historia de la Ley, archivos, portal Congreso Virtual) lo que dificulta que las personas puedan acceder a esta expeditamente y contar con la trazabilidad en un solo sitio de los proyectos de ley. Por otro lado, no hay un proceso estandarizado entre todas las instancias del Congreso Nacional para registrar la información en el SIL, por lo que algunos datos sobre los proyectos de ley o legislación aprobada pueden variar, causando confusión entre los y las usuarias del SIL. 

¿Cuál es el compromiso? Elaborar un diagnóstico y una propuesta de diseño, con participación ciudadana, para la actualización de la plataforma SIL y su interoperabilidad con las distintas páginas y sitios web del Congreso Nacional (Cámaras y BCN), teniendo en cuenta mejorar la usabilidad y transparencia con el objetivo de mostrar la trazabilidad legislativa completa de los proyectos de ley, facilitando la consulta pública respecto a esta información con formatos accesibles y reutilizables. Elaborar un manual y realizar capacitaciones para estandarizar los procesos en las distintas instancias que registran información en el SIL. Realizar un análisis comparativo para diseñar una metodología participativa que incorpore indicadores con una valoración cuantitativa-cualitativa para medir la gestión legislativa logrando el equilibrio adecuado entre calidad, cantidad y rapidez, y, que permitan realizar mejoras continuas de la calidad, eficiencia y eficacia del proceso legislativo. 48 

¿Cómo contribuirá a resolver la problemática? Existe una brecha de transparencia y trazabilidad para la ciudadanía y grupos de interés sobre los detalles de los contenidos, intervenciones e influencias ocurridas en el proceso legislativo. El compromiso constituye un primer paso para simplificar el acceso a la información sobre el contenido y evolución de los textos legislativos desde que se presenta el proyecto de ley hasta que se aprueba, lo que permitirá también fomentar la participación ciudadana en el proceso de formación de la ley. La interoperabilidad de las distintas páginas y sitios web con el SIL incrementará la transparencia, acceso de información pública y rendición de cuentas de la actividad legislativa y parlamentaria. Se busca permitir seguir la huella legislativa de los proyectos de ley desde una sola plataforma. La estandarización de los procesos de alimentación del SIL, permitirá mejorar el acceso a esta información y también mejorar la percepción del trabajo legislativo otorgando mayor certeza y seguridad jurídica. Comenzar un trabajo participativo para construir el diseño de indicadores permitirá medir la gestión legislativa fortaleciendo el proceso y siendo una herramienta de rendición de cuentas del proceso legislativo, lo que podrá mejorar la percepción del trabajo legislativo. 

¿Por qué es relevante a los valores de OGP? Transparencia y rendición de cuentas El diseño de actualización del SIL y su interoperabilidad mejorarán el acceso a la información legislativa al estar en una sola plataforma dando cuenta del trabajo legislativo. Respecto a la rendición de cuentas se contará a partir del diseño de la metodología de indicadores con una herramienta para medir la gestión legislativa. Participación ciudadana La actualización de la plataforma del SIL y el diseño de la metodología de indicadores incorpora la participación y cocreación en todo el compromiso. Tecnología e innovación El diseño de interoperabilidad innovará en procesos y en el desarrollo de tecnología y puede llegar a constituir un cambio de paradigma en la apertura legislativa. ¿Se vincula con un Objetivo de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS)?

CL0070,Chile,5,10,CHL,Americas,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Transparencia del Congreso Nacional,Transparency of the National Congress,"¿Cuál es la problemática que el compromiso aborda? El Congreso Nacional se rige por el principio de transparencia consagrado en el artículo 8º y debe dar cumplimiento al artículo 7º de la Ley de Transparencia de la Función Pública y Acceso a la Información de la Administración del Estado (transparencia activa), y con miras a fortalecer este principio, se presentó un proyecto de ley (Boletín 10.264-07, aprobado por la Comisión Especial de Probidad del Senado con participación continua de organizaciones de la sociedad civil, y que desde 2017 se encuentra en la Comisión de Constitución del Senado) que fortalece el proceso de acceso al a información pública, homologa los plazos a la Ley de Transparencia y procesos entre las Corporaciones, también crea una Dirección de Ética y Transparencia común para el Senado y la Cámara para revisar los reclamos, mejora la transparencia activa, entre otros cambios. En el I Plan de Acción de Parlamento Abierto también se incluyeron dos compromisos para fortalecer la transparencia, los cuales quedaron plasmados en el Boletín mencionado. Sin embargo, ya que dicho proyecto de ley no ha tenido movimiento, es necesario avanzar tomando el ejemplo del reglamento de participación ciudadana. Un indicador importante que muestra la necesidad de que el Congreso Nacional avance en esta materia es el Índice Latinoamericano de Transparencia Legislativa, ya que desde 2016, Chile ha mantenido un promedio de 64.5 por ciento sobre cien. Reconociendo que la transparencia debe asegurar un flujo abierto y focalizado de información para los distintos grupos de interés del poder legislativo, se requiere desarrollar con mayor profundidad este principio a través de la homologación de los procesos y regulación de la publicación, plazos, formatos de transparencia activa. Por el otro lado, aunque en materia de transparencia pasiva no está incluido el Congreso Nacional en la Ley de Transparencia de la Función Pública y Acceso a la Información de la Administración del 52 Estado, sin embargo, las organizaciones propusieron en este compromiso que se homologaran los plazos a la Ley, así como considerar la utilización de formatos uniformes de solicitud de información entre las Corporaciones y la BCN para garantizar y facilitar el acceso a la información pública. Finalmente, retomando un compromiso del I Plan de Acción, se propone trabajar participativamente con la sociedad civil organizada para contar con un sitio web estructurado que fomente la accesibilidad e inclusión de la información a través de una estructura clara que facilite la búsqueda de la información activa y proactiva y que sea de utilidad para los y las usuarios, por ejemplo, a través de visualizaciones del trabajo parlamentario con perspectiva de género. 

¿Cuál es el compromiso? Redactar los Reglamentos sobre Transparencia y Acceso a la Información del Congreso Nacional y la BCN que profundicen el principio de transparencia con definiciones, plazos de actualización de transparencia activa, formatos de publicación, plazos para responder solicitudes de información, un formato de solicitud de información homologado para las tres instituciones y periodo de actualización de los Reglamentos. Por otro lado, facilitar el acceso a la información pública por medio de estructurar e implementar www.congreso.cl para organizar y facilitar el acceso a la información publicada vía transparencia activa y proactiva generando además estadísticas e indicadores de cumplimiento. 

¿Cómo contribuirá a resolver la problemática? Eliminará los obstáculos para que la ciudadanía pueda acceder de forma más eficiente y expedita a la información que publica el Congreso Nacional y la BCN; se podrán presentar solicitudes de acceso a la información con un proceso homologado en las tres instituciones, y, contar con un sitio común que estructure y publique la información activa y proactiva de manera de facilitar su acceso, uso y comprensión. 

¿Por qué es relevante a los valores de OGP? Mejora los estándares de transparencia activa y pasiva porque homologa y regula el acceso a la información, profundizando y garantizando el principio de transparencia de la Cámara de Diputadas y Diputados, del Senado y la BCN. ¿Se vincula con un Objetivo de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS)?

El compromiso busca diseñar de manera participativa un chatbot basado en la herramienta CAMINAR de la Cámara de Diputadas y Diputados y otras herramientas para facilitar la participación ciudadana en el Congreso Virtual, incrementando la incidencia de las propuestas ciudadanas en el proceso legislativo. Lidera este compromiso el Grupo Bicameral de Transparencia del Congreso Nacional, la asesora de éste. Entre las partes interesadas de apoyo a nivel de Gobierno se considera el Laboratorio de Gobierno. Con respecto a la sociedad civil, se consideran a Goblab de la Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, la Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de Valparaíso (UV) y Centro Nacional de Inteligencia Artificial (CENIA). Entre otros actores como partes interesadas se considera a la Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional (BCN), ParlAmericas, Congreso de Brasil, CEPAL, BID y la Cámara de Representantes de Canadá. 

b. Definición del problema 

iv. ¿Cuál es el problema que el compromiso busca abordar? La plataforma del Congreso Virtual de Chile, establecida en 2020 para fomentar la participación ciudadana en el debate legislativo, proyecto liderado por el Grupo Bicameral de Transparencia y apoyado por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo, aún enfrenta desafíos en cuanto a su impacto real. Según los resultados preliminares de un estudio sobre la incidencia de la participación, se observa que varios proyectos de ley ya aprobados y que en su momento fueron publicados en el portal del Congreso Virtual, no reflejan en sus antecedentes o historial la contribución ciudadana realizada a través de esta plataforma. Este hallazgo sugiere una incidencia baja de las propuestas ciudadanas en el Congreso Virtual en relación con el trabajo legislativo, uno de los objetivos fundamentales de la plataforma. Se entiende por incidencia que uno o más comentarios ciudadanos sean presentado(s) como indicaciones. Esta situación afecta a las más de treinta mil personas registradas en el Congreso Virtual que contribuyen con sus opiniones y propuestas, sin que estas estén teniendo una influencia real en la formulación de las leyes. Asimismo, se ve afectado el trabajo legislativo del Congreso, que pierde la oportunidad de nutrir la discusión con contribuciones valiosas desde los territorios, las experiencias concretas de la ciudadanía y las voces expertas de la sociedad civil y academia. 

v. ¿Cuáles son las causas del problema? Se ha identificado un caso específico en el que la comisión solicitó la apertura de un proceso de consulta en el Congreso Virtual, y algunas de las indicaciones ciudadanas fueron presentadas por los parlamentarios y el Ejecutivo en el proceso legislativo. En este caso, la Unidad de Vinculación Ciudadana del Senado reformuló los comentarios ciudadanos como indicaciones. Estos resultados preliminares apuntan a diversas causas que explican la falta de incidencia de la participación ciudadana en el Congreso Virtual:  Bajo nivel de apropiación del Congreso Virtual: Parlamentarios y equipos legislativos desconocen los alcances e importancia del Congreso Virtual como instancia de participación y su potencial para fortalecer proyectos de ley.  Insuficientes esfuerzos de difusión: Es necesario mejorar la difusión de los resultados de la participación en el Congreso Virtual de cara a las comisiones, parlamentarios/as y Poder Ejecutivo.  Lenguaje coloquial o informal: El lenguaje de algunas contribuciones ciudadanas, al ser coloquial o informal, puede dificultar que sean consideradas o entendidas como sugerencias formales por los legisladores/as.  Concentración de la participación y falta de estrategia comunicacional: La participación se concentra en una región, y no hay una estrategia comunicacional efectiva que alcance a todo el país. La falta de acceso en zonas rurales también contribuye, ya que el porcentaje de población que utiliza internet en zonas urbanas es del 76,1%, mientras que en zonas rurales es del 46,6%, con brechas según el nivel económico (Subtel, 2020). 

c. Descripción del compromiso 

i. ¿Qué se ha hecho hasta ahora para resolver el problema? El Congreso Virtual tiene 3 años y 5 meses y, actualmente, se están analizando métricas |de incidencia por primera vez. No se han implementado soluciones específicas para abordar la baja incidencia de las propuestas ciudadanas en el Congreso Virtual. Los esfuerzos realizados se han centrado en mejoras de usabilidad, y aún está en la fase inicial de análisis su impacto en el proceso legislativo. 

ii. ¿Qué solución se propone? Se plantea el desarrollo de un chatbot que, en base a inteligencia artificial, cumpla una función de apoyo y facilitación de los aportes ciudadanos en el Congreso Virtual. Por una parte, asistirá a los participantes que lo requieran para estructurar formalmente sus comentarios o convertir sus opiniones en indicaciones. Y por otra, resolvería consultas y dudas frecuentes sobre proyectos de ley en lenguaje claro. Para su implementación, se aprovecharía la experiencia del trabajo de la Secretaría General de la Cámara de Diputadas y Diputados con el programa CAMINAR y otras herramientas. El proyecto CAMINAR ya está en etapa piloto y utiliza capacidades de procesamiento de lenguaje natural para tareas como redactar borradores de mociones legislativas, identificar normativas aplicables o detectar inconsistencias en los textos legales. La funcionalidad del chatbot incorporaría estos desarrollos previos en inteligencia artificial aplicada al trabajo legislativo, así como otros que pudiesen surgir. 

iii. ¿Qué resultados queremos lograr con la implementación de este compromiso? El objetivo principal de este compromiso es potenciar la participación ciudadana en el Congreso Virtual y que dicha participación tenga incidencia en los proyectos de ley. Se espera lograr los siguientes resultados:  Aumento de la incidencia y participación.  Mayor involucramiento legislativo: mediante una campaña de promoción, lograr que más parlamentarios/as y asesores/as conozcan y valoren el Congreso Virtual, presentando como propias las indicaciones ciudadanas de la plataforma y fomentando la comprensión de la importancia de la participación ciudadana y cómo esta puede fortalecer los procesos legislativos. 

d. Análisis del compromiso 

iv. ¿Cómo promoverá la transparencia? El compromiso contribuirá a la transparencia al incorporar información del Sistema de Información Legislativa en el chatbot en lenguaje claro. Este enfoque permitirá a la ciudadanía revisar información de los proyectos de ley de manera clara, mejorando su comprensión. Al hacer que la información sea más accesible y comprensible, se promoverá una mayor transparencia del proceso legislativo. Adicionalmente, promueve la difusión en los ministerios, tomando en consideración aquellas indicaciones propuestas por el Poder Ejecutivo. v. ¿Cómo ayudará el compromiso a fomentar la rendición de cuentas? El compromiso apoyará la rendición de cuentas al establecer la entrega de informes anuales sobre el uso de la plataforma con métricas de desempeño como hitos. Estos informes permitirán evaluar y comprender el impacto de la participación ciudadana en el Congreso Virtual. 

vi. ¿Cómo mejorará el compromiso la participación ciudadana en la definición, implementación y seguimiento de soluciones? El compromiso está diseñado específicamente para mejorar la participación ciudadana al involucrar proactivamente a la ciudadanía. La implementación de un chatbot, junto con un plan de difusión y promoción directa entre los parlamentarios/as, busca fomentar la participación y garantizar que esta tenga una incidencia real en la definición y formulación de proyectos de ley.

Definir estrategias, acciones y compromisos que permitan una labor legislativa más transparente y participativa que fortalezca la relación entre la ciudadanía y el Congreso.

¿Cuál es el problema que el compromiso busca abordar? 

Los costos económicos y sociales generados por las deficiencias de las entidades públicas en materia de transparencia y participación resultan muy altos en relación con la legitimidad y la confianza de parte de la ciudadanía en la corporación y sus procesos. Por lo anterior, es un deber y una prioridad del Congreso trabajar por la inclusión de procesos que contribuyan a acoger e implementar prácticas que promuevan la reducción de estos costos. 

¿Qué solución propone el compromiso? 

La construcción del Octavo Plan de Acción para un Congreso Abierto y Transparente el cual toma como base los principios de Gobierno Abierto, orientados al aumento del control político por parte de la ciudadanía, así como el acceso efectivo a la rendición de cuentas de las instituciones públicas. En dicho contexto, se estructurarán e implementarán estrategias y acciones específicas principalmente en lo relacionado con el acceso a la información y la promoción de espacios abiertos de participación directa de grupos de interés de la ciudadanía. Así mismo, permite que investigadores, estudiantes y organizaciones sociales tengan acceso a información estadística sobre tutelas, procesos de constitucionalidad, conflictos, providencias y el procedimiento legislativo especial para la paz

CR0054,Costa Rica,3,8,CRI,Americas,National,1,2017,2019,2,NA,POLÍTICA DE PARLAMENTO ABIERTO DE LA ASAMBLEA LEGISLATIVA DE LA REPÚBLICA DE COSTA RICA,Policy Open Parliament Legislative Assembly of the Republic of Costa Rica,"¿Cuál es la problemática que el compromiso aborda?
El Poder Legislativo ha sufrido una constante erosión al sentir los habitantes que no representa sus intereses y demandas, no promueve una efectiva participación en el proceso legislativo y que la legislación no es oportuna. Por ello, se pretende mejorar la interacción con los habitantes, en razón del mandato constitucional que dispone que el Estado costarricense debe ser popular, representativo, participativo, alternativo y responsable. La potestad de legislar reside en el pueblo, el cual la delega en la Asamblea Legislativa por medio del sufragio. Lo anterior implica una responsabilidad activa de los Poderes de la República en promover la participación, colaboración, transparencia, rendición de cuentas e innovación, en el caso de la Asamblea Legislativa en los procesos de legislar y control político.

¿Cuál es el compromiso?
El compromiso es crear e implementar una Política Institucional de Parlamento Abierto en la Asamblea Legislativa de Costa Rica.
Con ella se pretende establecer una nueva forma de interacción con los habitantes para fomentar la apertura, la transparencia, el acceso a la información pública, la redición de cuentas, la cocreación y participación ciudadana, la ética y la probidad mediante la innovación con el uso de nuevas tecnologías de información y la comunicación.
El objetivo general es elaborar conjuntamente con legisladores, administrativos y sociedad civil, en siete meses, un documento que oriente tres años acciones concretas que promuevan los principios que impulsa tanto la OGP como la Declaración sobre Transparencia Parlamentaria, la Hoja de Ruta hacia la Apertura Legislativa de ParlAmericas y el Convenio Marco para Promover un Estado Abierto de la República de Costa Rica.
Para el 2021, se espera lograr que los habitantes puedan conocer: la actividad y labor tanto de los diputados como de las fracciones políticas, desarrollar mecanismos e instrumentos de rendición de cuentas, contar con más y mejores mecanismos y procesos de participación activa de la sociedad con el Parlamento, emplear nuevas tecnologías de la información y mejorar la comunicación para transparentar las acciones y decisiones de los legisladores.

¿Cómo contribuirá a resolver la problemática?
Para mejorar la Rendición de cuentas: Dar a conocer las agendas, planes y programas de los legisladores y las fracciones, así como los informes de gastos y actividades realizadas por ellos. Suministrar información de asesores de diputados y fracciones. Dar a conocer los planes institucionales, las contrataciones y las ejecuciones presupuestarias. Implementar espacios de interacción directa de los diputados con los habitantes para su rendición de cuentas. Para fortalecer la participación ciudadana y colaboración activa en el proceso legislativo:
Desarrollar metodologías y herramientas virtuales de fomento de la participación ciudadana en el proceso de la ley y control político mediante consultas, chat, peticiones, comentarios y otros mecanismos interactivos. Establecer mecanismos de evaluación de la atención a los habitantes. Fomentar la participación de los habitantes en el monitoreo de los gastos institucionales y los presupuestos. Fortalecer los foros y encuentros presenciales de consulta, formación e información con diversos sectores y organizaciones de la sociedad civil para impulsar la participación en el proceso de la ley como un derecho humano, en especial con los grupos sociales más vulnerables. Para lograr una mayor transparencia y acceso a la Información (utilizando las tecnologías de la información y la comunicación): Comunicar e informar proactivamente la labor legislativa e institucional a los grupos vulnerables (Ley 7600). Desarrollar aplicaciones para dispositivos móviles de acuerdo con las necesidades de los habitantes sobre información legislativa e institucional. Establecer un registro individualizado del voto de cada legislador en Plenario y Comisión en formato abierto. Fortalecer la publicación proactiva de Datos abiertos para diferentes sectores y habitantes. Potenciar el uso de redes sociales para mejorar la comunicación con los habitantes. Potenciar la televisión (transmisión de comisiones) y el sitio web para permitir la interacción con los habitantes. Publicar los Informes de auditoría interna.

¿Por qué es relevante a los valores de OGP?Con una Política Institucional de Parlamento Abierto en la Asamblea Legislativa de Costa Rica se fortalecen los valores de la OGP, la Declaración sobre Transparencia Parlamentaria, la Hoja de Ruta hacia la Apertura Legislativa de ParlAmericas y el Convenio Marco para Promover un Estado Abierto de la República de Costa Rica.
En especial se mejoran los mecanismos para una mejor rendición de cuentas, se fortalece la participación ciudadana y la colaboración activa en el proceso legislativo, se logra una mayor transparencia y acceso a la Información utilizando las tecnologías de la información y la comunicación. En resumen:
Rendición de cuentas. Ampliar los mecanismos para fortalecer los foros y encuentros presenciales de consulta, formación e información con diversos sectores y organizaciones de la sociedad.
Tecnologías e innovación: Fortalecer los canales virtuales y televisivos con la sociedad. Fortalecer los chat y plataformas para interactuar con los habitantes. Impulsar la apertura de datos abiertos interoperables (formatos que permitan su uso, reutilización y redistribución por terceros para la generación de nuevo valor/ habilidad de sistemas para trabajar juntos e integrar conjuntos de datos).
Rendiciones de cuentas oportunas. Más y mejores espacios abiertos y públicos para que las personas puedan acceder a la Asamblea y darle seguimiento al proceso de la ley. Mejorar la atención ciudadana. Mejorar los Informes periódicos de gestión (proyectos, actividades, votaciones) Potenciar el uso de redes sociales para facilitar la participación de los habitantes.

En el estudio de opinión sociopolítica del Centro de Investigación y Estudios Políticos (CIEP) de noviembre de 2019 la Asamblea Legislativa obtiene una nota de 4.7 en términos de valoración ciudadana, únicamente por delante del gobierno y los partidos políticos. Además, la ciudadanía considera que sus demandas no son escuchadas ni representadas desde la institución, como lo revela el Estudio sobre legitimidad y eficacia de la Asamblea Legislativa realizado en el año 2017 por la organización ACCESA, el cual arrojó que las principales debilidades de la Asamblea Legislativa a visión de los entrevistados son los problemas de representatividad y la falta de compromiso con la ciudadanía. Dicho estudio también evidencia que lo que la ciudadanía más busca de la Asamblea Legislativa y sus diputados es percibir una mayor transparencia en su gestión y que tomen en cuenta la opinión ciudadana, especialmente en lo que refiere a la tramitación de los proyectos de ley. En respuesta a esta situación, la Asamblea Legislativa ha realizado acciones para incluir más a la ciudadanía y transparentar su accionar. Por ejemplo, en 2015 y 2016 creó en conjunto con la Alianza para una Asamblea 117 Abierta, dos planes de acción para promover la adopción de los principios de Parlamento Abierto dentro de la institución, y en abril del 2019 el Directorio Legislativo aprobó una Política Institucional de Parlamento Abierto (PIPA). Sin embargo, el grado de ejecución de estas iniciativas ha sido irregular y no se le ha dado el seguimiento debido. Además, desde el 2014 la Asamblea cuenta con un Departamento de Participación Ciudadana que tiene la función de promover la participación social activa en la Asamblea, mediante la generación de canales de comunicación que permitan una mayor vinculación con los representantes populares y la interacción en los procesos legislativos. Entre las principales iniciativas de este Departamento se encuentra el Programa de Parlamentos Cívicos o Foros Ciudadanos, el cual promueve la articulación de parlamentos sectoriales, a manera de espacios de capacitación e incidencia política ciudadana. No obstante, este Departamento se ha enfrentado a problemas presupuestarios y poco apoyo institucional para darle divulgación y difusión a sus acciones y para evaluar su impacto desde una perspectiva estratégica. Por otro lado, la Asamblea Legislativa es una de las instituciones nacionales que cuenta con instrumentos de acceso de la ciudadanía establecidos en su página web; no obstante, dicha página a percepción de las personas usuarias presenta algunos problemas de accesibilidad y de plataforma informática. A pesar de las acciones anteriormente descritas, en general la percepción de los habitantes es que la estructura de la Asamblea Legislativa contempla pocos espacios de diálogo y colaboración con la ciudadanía. Esta percepción se ve reflejada en los resultados del Índice de Transparencia Legislativa 2018, realizado por la Red Latinoamericana por la Transparencia Legislativa, en donde Costa Rica, a pesar de tener una calificación general privilegiada, obtuvo una nota de apenas 33,3 en el indicador de Participación Ciudadana, al juzgarse que no existían espacios adecuados para que la ciudadanía fuera consultada sobre los proyectos de ley. 

¿Cuál es el compromiso? Este compromiso pretende la apertura de espacios y procesos colaborativos en la Asamblea Legislativa mediante una estrategia integral, innovadora y multicanal de participación ciudadana. Para llevar a cabo este compromiso se realizarán las siguientes acciones de conformidad con el acuerdo número 10 de la sesión ordinaria del Directorio Legislativo No. 093-20205 : 

1. Hacer una consulta ciudadana del Portal Legislativo desde una perspectiva de accesibilidad universal, para señalar las falencias que tiene el sitio web actual en términos de publicación, ubicación, usabilidad y acceso de la información, así como en términos de claridad del lenguaje e interacción ciudadana y proponer acciones y recomendaciones de mejora. En virtud de lo anterior, la Comisión Institucional de Parlamento Abierto será la responsable de la planificación, ejecución y evaluación de dicha consulta y contará con el apoyo de los departamentos de Participación Ciudadana, Relaciones Públicas, Prensa y Protocolo e Informática: 

2. Establecer un foro cívico de Estado Abierto que convoque a ciudadanos y organizaciones de sociedad civil para evaluar la normativa existente en términos de transparencia, acceso a la información, rendición de cuentas y participación ciudadana, y que promueva propuestas nuevas y reformas a la legislación vigente. Estas propuestas serán presentadas a los diputados a la Asamblea Legislativa para su valoración y posible adopción. 

¿Cómo contribuirá el compromiso a solucionar el problema público? El compromiso busca definir de manera estratégica (con ejes, metas e indicadores) acciones claras y medibles para que la Asamblea Legislativa abra espacios multicanales que permitan a la ciudadanía implicarse en diversas áreas de la esfera legislativa, para que así la institución pueda aprovechar la inteligencia colectiva 5 Sesión celebrada el 18 de febrero de 2020. 119 para la mejora de la calidad y representatividad de las leyes y las políticas. El compromiso contribuirá a la creación e institucionalización de los espacios innovadores de participación ciudadana, así como a la articulación de todos esos espacios bajo un solo enfoque estratégico, con el fin último de mejorar la valoración de representatividad, transparencia y cercanía de la población hacia la Asamblea. Estas acciones al ser cocreadas con la sociedad civil buscan asegurar que estos espacios de participación ciudadana no respondan únicamente a la lógica legislativa, sino también a las necesidades e intereses de la ciudadanía. Además, al adoptar un enfoque multicanal que incluye tanto medios presenciales como digitales que pueden estimular el compromiso de diferentes sectores (incluida la población joven) a través de las nuevas tecnologías, se espera que se logre avanzar hacia una democracia más participativa que sea capaz de producir leyes y políticas más legítimas, efectivas y de mayor calidad. En ese sentido, son fundamentales las actividades previas de auditoría ciudadana del Portal Legislativo y de establecimiento del foro cívico de Estado Abierto, ya que estas acciones no solo podrán identificar debilidades actuales y proponer recomendaciones de mejora, sino que también permitirán articular, fortalecer y empoderar a los actores de sociedad civil y así crear las condiciones para que los diputados y diputadas se comprometan con una mayor participación ciudadana e interacción estructurada con la ciudadanía, por medios tanto presenciales como virtuales (a través del Portal Legislativo). A raíz de la pandemia ocasionada por el COVID-19 el uso de la tecnología es esencial para orientar la política pública y emigrar de la cultura del papel hacia nuevas formas de rendición de cuentas ante la ciudadanía. En ese contexto, los parlamentos están convocados a buscar las didácticas y la literatura necesaria para emigrar hacia un Estado inteligente; aquel que propicie un acercamiento ciudadano desde el uso de las nuevas 120 tecnologías de información y la comunicación para dar mayor transparencia a la función pública. En ese sentido, no solo el producto final, sino también las actividades que son parte del compromiso, son procesos participativos, innovadores y multicanal que esperan asentar experiencias replicables de vinculación entre la Asamblea Legislativa y la ciudadanía. 

¿Por qué este compromiso es relevante para los valores de OGP? El compromiso es relevante para la participación cívica porque crea nuevas oportunidades y herramientas para que el público influya en las discusiones y los proyectos de ley que se tramitan en la Asamblea Legislativa a través del Foro cívico de Estado Abierto, y potencia los espacios existentes bajo un enfoque más integrado y estratégico. Además, abre oportunidades para evaluar de forma colaborativa la información que publica la Asamblea Legislativa y para incidir de manera directa en la estrategia de participación ciudadana por la que se regirá la institución. 

Información adicional El compromiso está vinculado con la Política Institucional de Parlamento Abierto (PIPA) y las líneas de acción que ya ha venido realizando el Departamento de Participación Ciudadana de la Asamblea Legislativa, como el Programa de Parlamentos Cívicos. El compromiso está vinculado con el Objetivo de Desarrollo Sostenible N°16: “Promover sociedades pacíficas e inclusivas para el desarrollo sostenible, facilitar el acceso a la justicia para todos y crear instituciones eficaces, responsables e inclusivas a todos los niveles”.

La Asamblea Legislativa cuenta con la Política de Parlamento Abierto (PIPA) la cual fue aprobada en el año 2019, siendo unos de los primeros marcos de referencia institucional para desarrollar tanto a lo intemo como a lo externo, los principios de apertura, transprencia y rendición de cuentas de las acciones parlamentarias y de espacios de incidencia donde la sociedad civil puede ser Breve descripción parte de los procesos de toma de decisiones. del compromiso No obstante, el proceso de aprendizaje que ha desempeñado la existencia de esta política ha mostrado la necesidad de actualizarla y de incorporar nuevas visiones y mecanismos que fortalezcan las estrategias de divulgación, realimentación y cocreación de los espacios de incidencia en el ámbito parlamentario. Además, se evidencia la necesidad de implementar una estrategia formativa e informativa milticanal sobre el proceso de la ley, mecanismos de incidencia y cabildeo ciudadano, aspectos que serán contemplados para esta actualización. Este proceso conlleva la necesidad de concientizar al cuerpo institucional sobre la cultura, conducta, mecanismos y procedimientos de participación ciudadana, así como también la política deberá ser socializada con la ciudadanía, con la finalidad de generar como resultado proyectos en lenguaje claro en su planteamiento y por tanto al momento de ser entendida. Además, se pretende realizar campañas de divulgación en diferentes canales de comunicación sobre el quehacer legislativo, lo que propiciará una Asamblea Legislativa más participativa y transparente.

Definición del problema

1. ¿Cuál es el problema que el compromiso busca abordar? 

La Politica Institucional de Parlamento Abierto (PIPA) responde al primer compromiso adquirido por la Asamblea Legislativa en el Convenio Marco para Promover un Estado Abierto de la República de Costa Rica, suscrito entre el Poder Ejecutivo, el Poder Legislativo, el Poder Judicial y el Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones, el 21 de marzo de 2017 y con el compromiso N.* 8 del III Plan de Acción Nacional de Gobierno Abierto, presentado por Costa Rica ante la Alianza para el Gobierno Abierto (Open Government Partnership), en octubre de 2017. Este compromiso busca actualizar la Política Institucional de Parlamento Abierto (PIPA), la cual fue emitida desde el año 2019, y en el momento de su aprobación fue sometida a consulta tanto de la población legislativa, a través de las direcciones departamentales, como a organizaciones, ciudadanía, Jefaturas de Fracción y asesores(as) Parlamentarios(as) de los periodos (2017 y 2018) para finalmente someterla a la aprobación del Directorio Legislativo. En relación con esta actualización, se utilizaría el mismo procedimiento que se instauró para su aprobación, para efectos de analizar la incidencia y avances que se han obtenido en este tema dentro del Poder Legislativo desde el año 2019, involucrando factores relevantes como fueron la pandemia del Covid-19. Lo que se pretende es que una nueva política venga a fortalecer las estrategias de divulgación, retroalimentación y cocreación de los mecanismos de incidencia de los habitantes dado que la consulta realizada en el V Plan de Acción, los ciudadanos se quejaron de la falta de mecanismos de información sobre los espacios de incidencia del Departamento de Participación Ciudadana. De igual manera, se ve la posibilidad de implementar una estrategia formativa e informativa multicanal sobre el funcionamiento del proceso de la ley y mecanismos de incidencia, y cabildeo ciudadano. Asimismo, la Asamblea Legislativa deberá de concientizar en la propia institución todo lo relacionado con la cultura, conducta, mecanismos y procedimientos de participación ciudadana. La Asamblea Legislativa es una de las instituciones nacionales que cuenta con instrumantos de acceso de la ciudadanía establecidos en su página web; la cual cuenta con chat para consultas ciudadanas. Además, desde el 2014 la Asamblea cuenta con un Departamento de Participación Ciudadana que tiene la función de promover la participación social activa en la institución, mediante la generación de canales de comunicación que permitan una mayor vinculación con los representantes populares y la interacción en los procesos legislativos. Actualmente se reciben consultas por Whatsapp, chat, correo electrónico e incluso vía telefónica, asimismo se promueve la rendición de cuentas y la formación ciudadana para una mayor incidencia mediante foros, capacitaciones, mesas de trabajo, giras, entre otros. Luego de la evaluación realizada en los años 2021-2022 por la misma ciudadanía (IV Plan de Acción), se le está realizando cambios estructurales muy importantes para solucionar algunos problemas de accesibilidad y de plataforma informática. Asimismo, el Poder Legislativo cuenta con un canal televisivo en casi todas las cableras del país, así como acceso a una emisora radial, canal de Youtube, y la retransmisión en vivo de todas las sesiones del plenario legislativo y las comisiones. A pesar de las acciones anteriormente descritas, en general la percepción de los habitantes es que la estructura de la Asamblea Legislativa contempla pocos espacios de diálogo y colaboración con la ciudadanía. Esta percepción se ve reflejada en los resultados de los talleres regionales que se realizaron dónde se citan cómo dos grandes ejes: 3. Divulgación accesible y comprensible del quehacer legislativo; 4. Educación ciudadana sobre el procedimiento legislativo y los mecanismos de incidencia ciudadana.

2. ¿Cuáles son las causas del problema? 

Durante la pandemia del Covid-19, en las diferentes instituciones del Estado costarricense existieron serias restricciones y no fue posible desarrollar acciones que permitieran la adecuada socialización de la PIPA, tanto a nivel administrativo como con la ciudadanía, de ahí la importancia de la actualización de la política y de ejecutar las gestiones necesarias para alcanzar dicho fin. La política actual fue un avance, pero necesita ajustarse a los nuevos cambios que enfrenta el Congreso. Una de las falencias a corregir es que no existen en la institución mecanismos efectivos para la evaluación ciudadana sobre el desempeño de la Asamblea Legislativa y se necesita una mayor socialización y promoción de las acciones y espacios de incidencia ciudadana que se disponen. 

3. ¿De qué manera éste problema afecta a mujeres y hombres? 

En Costa Rica se han realizado muchos esfuerzos por cerrar la brecha existente entre hombres y mujeres. Una de las acciones que se han realizado es la paridad que existe en la Asamblea Legislativa, no obstante todavía hay otras organizaciones que deben de avanzar en este tema, como juntas directiva, cooperativas, entre otras. Es así que en nuestro país sigue siendo mayor la cantidad de mujeres que dejan la educación secundaria, que viven en estado de pobreza, que más sufren violencia doméstica y sufren más discriminación en los trabajos. Es por ello, que en las diferentes capacitaciones y espacios de cocreación, se debe de tomar en cuenta al sector de mujeres y brindarlas en horarios dónde ellas puedan accesar, además contar con entornos seguros y con perspectiva de género. La Política Institucional de Parlamento Abierto debe de responder a este sector de la sociedad civil. Para realizar estas acciones, se accederá a base datos que posean las diferentes oficinas de la mujer en cada cantón del país, así como a bases de datos del INAMU, la UTIEG y el Departamento de Participación Ciudadana para poder convocar a la mayor cantidad posible de mujeres y las diferentes organizaciones que las representan. 

4. ¿El problema afecta a una población en situación de vulnerabilidad específica? 

Sí porque la política de la institución, debe de contemplar acciones que busquen ser transversales y respondan a la interseccionalidad, debe de cubrir a las mujeres rurales, mujeres trans y todo los demás sectores en estado de vulnerabilidad, como adultos mayores, población indígena, personas con discapacidad, jóvenes, entre otros. Los espacios de formación e incidencia deben de adaptarse, en el caso de la población indígena ponerlo en su idioma y respectar la cosmovisión, realizarlos en horarios dónde sea accesible para todos estos sectores antes mencionados. La estrategia de información y mediación formativa debe de responder a enfoques de equidad e igualdad de género e interseccionalidades, se pretende buscar mecanismo de colaboración multiactor en el desarrollo de los materiales, estrategia y evaluación de las capacitaciones estratégicas formativas y metodologías de incidencia multiactor. 

Descripción del compromiso

1. ¿Qué se ha hecho hasta ahora para resolver el problema? 

La Asamblea Legislativa desde la implementación de la Política de Parlamento Abierto, ha realizado diversas acciones encaminadas a socializar la PIPA, no sólo a nivel interno sino también con miras a la sociedad civil, academia, sector privado e instituionalidad por medio de foros multiactores que ha permitido la ejecución desde una perspectiva ciudadana, el desarrollo de los diferentes ejes estratégicos de la PIPA en las diversas áreas de la institución. Una de las acciones más palpables que se ha logrado culminar en el Poder Legislativo es precisamente la ejecución del compromiso adquirido en el IV Plan de Acción Nacional de Gobierno Abierto, el cual logró realizar la consulta ciudadana del Portal Legislativo desde una perspectiva de accesibilidad universal, para señalar las falencias que tiene el sitio web actual en términos de publicación, ubicación, usabilidad y acceso de la información, así como en términos de claridad del lenguaje e interacción ciudadana y proponer acciones y recomendaciones de mejora. En este momento la Comisión Institucional de Portal Legislativo está en la transformación de la página web implementando todas las recomendaciones realizadas por la sociedad civil que participaron en la evaluación del Portal Legislativo. Por su parte, la Comisión Institucional de Parlamento Abierto es la responsable de la planificación, ejecución y evaluación de dicha consulta y contará con el apoyo de los departamentos de Participación Ciudadana, Relaciones Públicas, Prensa y Protocolo e Informática. Asimismo, se realizó el foro cívico de Estado Abierto (Parlamento Cívico de Estado Abierto) que convocó a ciudadanía y organizaciones de sociedad civil para evaluar la normativa existente en términos de transparencia, acceso a la información, rendición de cuentas y participación ciudadana, y que promueva propuestas nuevas y reformas a la legislación vigente. Estas propuestas serán presentadas a las y los diputados de la Asamblea Legislativa para su valoración y posible adopción, como ejecución del IV Plan de Acción informe final que fue entregado en su momento procesal. 

2. ¿Qué solución propone? 

Lo que se pretende con este compromiso es actualizar y socializar la Política Institucional de Parlamento Abierto, incluyendo acciones que se puedan hacer para mejorar la transparencia, comunicación con los ciudadanos, abrir más espacios para interactuar con los ciudadanos y la población en general, realizar documentos como los proyectos de ley en un lenguaje claro, que permite a las personas entender de una manera más sencilla de las leyes de la república. Lo anterior, se realizará por medio de la inclusión del lenguaje claro en los proyectos de ley que se presenten y la legislación, realizar campañas de divulgación por los diferentes canales que se tienen a disposición para la formación cívica del quehacer legislativo, así cómo de otros formatos que que permita a la ciudadanía una mayor incidencia en la Asamblea Legislativa. Además, se pondrán en marcha diversos mecanismos para la implementación de la Política Institucional de Parlamento Abierto tanto a nivel administrativo cómo con la sociedad civil. Es importante que se conforme un mecanismo de evaluación (formulario digital para evaluación) que se aplique mínimo cada 4 años para evaluar la PIPA y que el mismo permita darle seguimiento a dicha política. 

3. ¿Qué resultados queremos lograr a corto y mediano plazo con la implementación de este compromiso? 

El compromiso busca definir de manera estratégica (con ejes, metas e indicadores) acciones claras y medibles para que la Asamblea Legislativa abra espacios multicanales que permitan a la ciudadanía implicarse en la actualización de la Politica Institucional de Parlamento Abierto en las diversas áreas de la esfera legislativa, para que así la institución pueda aprovechar la inteligencia colectiva para la mejora de la calidad y representatividad de las leyes y las políticas. El compromiso contribuirá a la creación e institucionalización de los espacios innovadores de participacion ciudadana, promoviendo información oportuna, formación y publicación de los mecanismo de incidencia que responden a los habitantes, así como a la articulación de todos esos espacios bajo un solo enfoque estratégico, con el fin de mejorar la valoración de representatividad, transparencia y cercanía de la población hacia la Asamblea. El hecho de que la estrategia sea cocreada con la sociedad civil busca asegurar que las acciones de participación ciudadana no respondan únicamente a la lógica legislativa, sino también a las necesidades e intereses de la ciudadanía. Además, al adoptar un enfoque multicanal que incluye tanto medios presenciales como digitales que pueden estimular el compromiso de diferentes públicos (incluida la población joven) a través de las nuevas tecnologías, se espera que se logre avanzar hacia una democracia más participativa que sea capaz de producir leyes y políticas más legítimas, efectivas y de mayor calidad. En ese sentido, son fundamentales las actividades previas de auditoría ciudadana de la PIPA, así como las diversas campañas de divulgación por los diferentes medios digitales, prensa y TV que maneja la institución las cuales le permitirán al ciudadano, poder contar con acceso para lograr un mejor entendimiento de todo el quehacer legislativo. Asimismo, se desarrollarán campañas de divulgación utilizando diversos medios o instrumentos para que la ciudadanía pueda conocer cuáles son los mecanismos de incidencia ciudadana que se encuentran establecidos en la institución. Estas acciones no solo podrán identificar debilidades actuales y proponer recomendaciones de mejora (que serán el punto de partida de la elaboración de la estrategia), sino que también permitirán articular, fortalecer y empoderar a los actores de sociedad civil y así crear las condiciones para que los diputados y diputadas se comprometan con una mayor participación ciudadana e interacción estructurada con la ciudadanía, por medio de actividades tanto presenciales como virtuales (a través del Portal Legislativo). En ese sentido, no solo el producto final, sino también las actividades que son parte de la cocreación e implementación del compromiso son procesos participativos, innovadores y multicanal que esperan asentar experiencias replicables de vinculación entre la Asamblea Legislativa y la ciudadanía.

Análisis del compromiso

1. ¿Cómo promoverá la transparencia el compromiso? La Transparencia es uno de los ejes estratégicos de compromiso? la Politica Institucional de Parlamento Abierto (PIPA) que implicará que el derecho de acceso a la información sea confiable y accesible sobre los actos que ejecuta la Asamblea Legislativa, abre oportunidades para evaluar de forma colaborativa la información que publica la Asamblea Legislativa y para incidir de manera directa en la estrategia de participación ciudadana por la que se regirá la institución. Asimismo, es importante señalar que la institución cuenta con varias herramientas tanto a nivel periodístico cómo de web, principalmente el Portal Legislativo el cual se encuentra en etapa de actualización de ajuste para ser cada vez más accesible y responder a los mecanismos de incidencia ciudadana. Las acciones que se ejecutarán están descritas en los diferentes hitos que se desarrollan en esta plantilla

2. ¿Cómo ayudará el compromiso a fomentar la rendición de cuentas? Otro de los ejes estratégicos de la Política Institucional de Parlamento Abierto (PIPA) es la rendición de cuentas que consiste en el deber de toda autoridad de explicar, justificar, fundamentar, evaluar resultados y comunicar las decisiones y acciones que toma sobre los recursos públicos que reciba o ejerza ante la ciudadanía. Lo anterior, lo realiza la institución por medio de los diversos canales de retroalimentación que se encuentran orientados todos de cara a la ciudadanía. Las acciones que se ejecutarán están descritas en los diferentes hitos que se desarrollan en esta plantilla.

3. ¿Cómo mejorará el compromiso la participación ciudadana en la definición, implementación y seguimiento de soluciones? La Participación Ciudadana también forma parte de los ejes estratégicos de la Política Institucional de Parlamento Abierto (PIPA), la participación activa de las y los ciudadanos en aquellos procesos de toma de decisiones de los asuntos propios del parlamento como el proceso de elaboración de la ley y control político en los que tengan un interés legítimo. Se involucrará a la sociedad civil por medio de la participación del Parlamento Cívico. de Estado Abierto y los talleres multiactor que para el efecto se van a convocar.

4. ¿Cómo contribuye el compromiso en materia de inclusión de género? 1. PIPA: Se definirán criterios de género y de diferentes grupos de organizaciones de mujeres que participaran en la cocreación de esta política. 2. Dentro de la campaña de formación del quehacer legislativo y los mecanismos de incidencia ciudadana se incluirían diversas acciones encaminadas a la paridad de género y a la visión de las nuevas masculinidades y de todas las poblaciones vulnerables.

 Description of the measure
 Which public issue does the measure address? The transparency of financing and implementing effective supervision of
 the financing of political parties and election campaigns contributes to
 public trust in election processes and has an important role in
 strengthening preventive measures in the fight against corruption. At the
 moment, a high degree of transparency regarding political financing has
 been assured, supervision mechanisms have been put in place, and 
 26
 administrative and misdemeanour sanctions envisaged for violations of
 the provisions of the Act on Financing Political Parties and Election
 Campaigns. However, problems have been noted in implementing
 supervision, caused by the high number of subjects for supervision and
 the means by which financial reports are submitted and published. In
 fact, the financing of political activities and election campaigns is
 regulated by the Act in a transparent way, but due to the noted
 shortcomings of the current solution (according to which financial reports,
 report on donations, electoral campaign costs and other prescribed
 reports are published on the websites of the subjects of supervision and
 in various printed media, which makes supervising and monitoring
 political financing by the public more difficult), it must be improved in the
 sense of introducing an IT system for supervising financing, by which the
 subject of supervision would submit all prescribed reports to the
 competent bodies and ensure the publication of all prescribed reports by
 subjects of supervision via this IT system in one place, on the website of
 the supervisory body, which would allow more effective supervision and
 monitoring of political financing by the public. In addition, financing
 referendum activities, which is not governed at all at the moment by any
 regulations, would be regulated by law in a transparent manner. Also, for
 the proper application of the Act, it is necessary to ensure the
 implementation of activities to inform the subjects of supervision of the
 regulations governing the financing of political activities and the ongoing
 education of persons obliged to apply the Act and those covered by
 supervision.
 What does the measure include? The measure includes improving the way in which financial reports,
 reports on donations, reports on the costs of election campaigns and
 other prescribed reports, ensuring the legal presuppositions for
 establishing an IT system for supervising financing, are submitted and
 published, and the establishment of this IT system, by which the subjects
 of supervision (participants in election campaigns and participants in the
 regular financing of political activities) would submit to the competent
 bodies financial reports, reports on donations, reports on the costs of
 election campaigns, and other prescribed reports, in electronic form, by
 entering them in the IT system for supervising financing, and publishing 
 27
 them through this system in a single place – the website of the State
 Electoral Commission.
 The measure also includes the legal regulation of financing referendum
 activities. The implementation of the measure will ensure efficient
 supervision and the establishment of a permanently available, easily
 searchable database, and will make it easier for the public to monitor
 political financing. In addition, with the aim of assuring that the proposed
 measures are feasible, activities are envisaged to educate parties,
 independent members of Parliament, members of representative bodies
 of units of local and regional self-government and election participants.
 The overall goal of the measure is to raise the level of transparency in
 financing regular political activities, elections and referenda.
 How does the measure contribute to resolving the public
 issue?
 By setting up an IT system for supervising financing, by which all reports
 relating to the financing of political activities and election campaigns will
 be published in a single place, for all subjects, simpler access to data will
 be assured and thus more efficient supervision, which will make it easier
 for the public to monitor the financing of political activities and election
 campaigns.
 In addition, the prerequisites for monitoring the financing of referendum
 activities will be assured.
 This will improve the transparency of financing such activities and have
 anti-corruption effects. The transparency of financing political activities
 and election campaigns will be further guaranteed by implementing
 training for the participants in these activities.
 Why is this measure relevant to the values of the Open
 Government Partnership?
 The measure is relevant to transparency, since it guarantees public
 access to information on the financing of political parties and election
 campaigns by improving publication means (financial reports, reports on
 donations, and other prescribed reports) which, instead of being
 published on the websites of the various subjects of supervision, will be
 published via the IT system for supervising financing in a single place for
 all subjects – on the website of the State Electoral Commission. This
 means that the public will have easier access to data on financing
 political activities and election campaigns.
 28
 The measure also assures the transparent financing of referendum
 activities, which are not at present regulated by law, and guarantees the
 public's access to information on financing referendum activities.
 At the same time, the measure is relevant in terms of public
 accountability, since transparent reporting on financial dealings is
 assured by a mechanism by which the public can hold civil servants and
 politicians accountable, particularly regarding the use of public funds.
 Additional information The total cost of implementing the measure is HRK 600,000 for the
 activities of the State Electoral Commission, while the activities of the
 Ministry of Administration are guaranteed in the State Budget, section
 Ministry of Administration 09505, activity A83000, within the regular work
 of the Ministry of Administration (with no additional costs).

HR0044,Croatia,4,4,HRV,Europe,National,1,2022,2024,2,Transparency,Openness and Transparency of the Croatian Parliament,Education on Parliamentary Engagement,"Which public issue does the measure address? The measure contributes to increasing the openness and transparency of the Croatian Parliament and informing and, where possible, involving citizens in participating in the processes of shaping, deciding and monitoring the implementation of public policies, open government and good governance. 

What does the measure include? The measure includes the promotion and implementation of educational programmes and workshops adapted to different target groups and their needs. The aim of educational programmes for primary and secondary school students as well as college students is to increase the level of knowledge and competences and prepare them for participation in democratic decision-making processes. Through educational workshops for citizens, in accordance with epidemiological measures, interested citizens will be educated on various topics and opportunities to participate in decision-making processes (e.g. how and to whom to write a petition or proposal and then send it to a specific working body depending on the field of work, how to write a draft of a legislative proposal, how to participate in the process of public consultation on draft acts in the process of their adoption, the proposers of which are Members of Parliament, working bodies and members' clubs). 

In accordance with epidemiological measures, in addition to the already existing educational visits for students of lower grades (3rd and 4th grade) and students of higher grades (5th, 6th, 7th and 8th grade), an online quiz for students of the 8th grade ""How well do you know the Croatian Parliament?"", the educational programme is expanding with the opening of a Competition in writing an essay/representative speech on a given topic for students of the 8th grade. The invitation to students follows the educational outcomes of the curriculum of the subject History for the 8th grade of primary school, especially the teaching unit The Emergence of the Sovereign and Independent State of Croatia and the role and significance of the Croatian Parliament in the creation of the Republic of Croatia. The students write an essay/parliamentary speech which focuses on the basic state legal acts passed by the Parliament that are significant for the creation of the sovereign Republic of Croatia and its political structure. The purpose and aim of the competition in the writing of essays/parliamentary speeches for students in the 8th grade of primary schools is to develop the historical literacy of students and to encourage them to develop historical thinking, critical reflection, familiarise them with democratic procedures and nurture democratic principles and values. By familiarising with the 28 modern political history students understand political activity and are becoming acquainted with the process of building authority and state institutions.

In accordance with epidemiological measures, programmes for high school students include educational visits to the Croatian Parliament, which, along with a tour of the Parliament with expert guidance, also include a lecture for students that follows the subject curricula, attendance at the Parliament session from the gallery in the Parliament and the opportunity to interact with the representatives. The lecture refers mainly to the knowledge that students need to adopt from the field of the political system of the Republic of Croatia and the organisation of state power, and it is also related to the knowledge that students need to adopt for taking the exam in the subject Politics and Economics at the state graduation (matura) exams. In addition, a Simulated Parliament for high school students is planned to be held annually in Sabornica, with expert support to teachers for the preparation of a simulated student parliament. By simulating parliamentary work in the Croatian Parliament – from working in members' clubs, responsible committees and at the Parliament session – students directly acquire knowledge about the legislative procedure and the course of law-making. Teachers prepare students for a simulated session as part of the following classes: Politics and Economics, Sociology, Philosophy, Ethics, interdisciplinary Civic Education, History and legal groups of subjects: Introduction to State and Law, Constitutional Set-up of Croatia, etc. The goals of conducting this training programme are: to provide students with practical experience of the activities of the legislature and the role of members, their work in parliamentary committees and in members' clubs, to clarify to students the process of making public policies until the adoption of laws, to encourage and develop political opinion and critical thinking of a student who is familiarising himself with the role and responsibility of the authorities, the sources of its legitimacy, the importance of the legislative procedure and respect for democratic procedures in the process of adopting laws and the importance of complying with the laws in force. The purpose of conducting this educational programme is to enable students to acquire knowledge through practice about politics as content, political institutions and political processes, as well as to encourage the active participation of young people in public policy-making and inclusion in decision-making processes. In addition, an online quiz competition for high school students called ""How much do you know the Croatian Parliament?"" will be organised on an annual basis. Quiz questions arise from the curriculum for the subject Politics and Economics in conjunction with the curricula of the legal group of subjects and other related subjects in the social sciences and humanities field. This educational programme has two goals: the first is to provide students with the opportunity to test their knowledge of the Parliament, its structure and competences, as well as procedures in the adoption of acts, and the rights and obligations of Members of Parliament, and the second is to motivate students to gain additional knowledge about the role and place of the Parliament in the Republic of Croatia from the constitution of the first democratic multi-party Parliament on 30 May 1990 to the present day, which implies all those constitutional powers of the Parliament as a Parliament of one of the Member States of the European Union. Competition in writing essays or parliamentary speeches on a given topic is organised for high school students. The invitation to the students follows the educational outcomes of the curriculum of the subject Politics and Economics for high schools in conjunction with the curricula of the legal group of subjects and other related subjects in the social sciences and humanities field. The students write an essay/parliamentary speech examining the basic state- forming acts adopted by the Parliament. The expected educational outcomes of such teaching will enable students to familiarise themselves with the political system of the Republic of Croatia and the structure, role and responsibility 29 of the authorities and the sources of its legitimacy even better. The purpose and aim of the competition in writing essays/parliamentary speeches for high school students is to develop their political literacy and to encourage students to develop political thinking, and critical reflection, to familiarise them with democratic procedures and nurture democratic principles and values. 

The programme for students of higher education institutions includes a lecture for students on the organisation, powers and working methods of the Parliament and its working parties, members' clubs, legislative procedure, rights and obligations of members, tasks and working methods of the Parliament and its working parties in European affairs, etc. Part of the programme includes organising a simulated student Parliament in the Parliament. By participating in the project Simulated Parliament, students have the opportunity to expand their knowledge about the legislative procedure and the working methods of the Croatian Parliament, as well as to improve their rhetorical skills and ability to conduct an informed discussion and the importance of participating in political processes in general. Therefore, the aim of this project is to educate students about the work of the Parliament, as well as to stimulate their interest and motivate them to engage more in politics by raising awareness of the importance of active participation in political processes. The programme also enables the organisation of discussions/thematic discussions of students with members - members of the parliamentary committees, on a pre-agreed topic, the organisation of lectures on a pre- agreed topic held by the lecturers of the Citizens Service as well as lecturers from other specialist services of the Parliament. 

In addition, in accordance with epidemiological measures, educational workshops for citizens will be conducted through which interested citizens will be educated on various topics and possibilities of participation in decision- making processes (e.g. how to write a petition or proposal and to which working body to refer it, depending on the field of the work, how to write a draft legislative proposal, how to participate in the process of public consultation on draft acts in the process of their adoption, the proposers of which are Members of Parliament, working bodies and members' clubs). 

How does the measure contribute to resolving the public issue? The measure will contribute to even greater openness and transparency of the Croatian Parliament, and will also contribute to better information and, where possible, the involvement of citizens in participating in the processes of shaping, deciding and monitoring the implementation of public policies and open government and good governance. 

Why is this measure relevant to the values of the Open Government Partnership? The measure is relevant for achieving the values of the Open Government Partnership because it increases the transparency of public authorities, enables participation of citizens, especially young people, with the aim of their stronger involvement and preparation for the decision-making process, to create a transparent and open society. The support of the Croatian Parliament to the education system through stronger involvement of young people in raising the level of competences and preparation for participation in decision-making processes is in accordance with the aim of raising the level of transparency and openness.

Additional information: The measure will be conducted within the framework of budget funds of the Croatian Parliament. 30

La Asamblea Nacional ha realizado avances normativos y de política en materia de transparencia y apertura legislativa, muestra de ello son las reformas a la Ley Orgánica de la Función Legislativa de 2020, la aprobación del Reglamento de Parlamento Abierto, la creación de un Grupo Parlamentario por el Parlamento Abierto, la conformación de un foro multiactor y mejoras en el sitio web. Sin perjuicio de lo anterior, es necesario mejorar órganos parlamentarios que aún son poco transparentes, así como, fortalecer la relación del parlamento con la ciudadanía a través del aprovechamiento del uso de la información publicada y los mecanismos de participación (conocer más en Índice Latinoamericano de Transparencia Legislativa). Las debilidades en materia de transparencia y apertura que afectan a los ciudadanos en general, ya que, la actividad legislativa influye en cada uno de los aspectos de la vida cotidiana, ya sea por la promulgación de una ley, por un proceso de juicio político a una persona elegida democráticamente, por los proyectos de ley que tiene como fin regular el actuar diario de una persona natural o jurídica, entre otros. 

¿Cuál es el compromiso? Impulsar un proceso participativo, inclusivo, y horizontal, para definir un nuevo catálogo de información legislativa, acorde a normativa aplicable a la Asamblea Nacional y estándares internacionales, así como, fortalecer los mecanismos para difundir información, no solo sobre la gestión de la Asamblea Nacional, sino también sobre las oportunidades de participación y vigilancia ciudadana del quehacer legislativo. Este compromiso será considerado como insumo para la cocreación del Plan de Acción de Parlamento Abierto independiente que se genere en la Asamblea Nacional. 

¿Cómo contribuirá a resolver la problemática? Corto plazo: • Plan de Acción de Parlamento Abierto que contemple los principios de transparencia, ética y probidad • Catálogo de información legislativa plenamente definido y detallado, que observe los estándares internacionales. • Mecanismos a través de los cuales se va a difundir el nuevo catálogo de información legislativa, tanto por medios digitales, como no digitales. • Involucramiento de la ciudadanía en los procesos de participación ciudadana en la Asamblea Nacional, así como, en los espacios de cocreación. Mediano plazo: • Difusión e implementación del Plan de Acción de Parlamento Abierto que fomenta la cocreación legislativa • Inclusión del nuevo catálogo legislativo en las normas jurídicas que contempla actualmente y que genera obligación de cumplimiento, como la Ley Orgánica de la Función Legislativa, el Reglamento para la Implementación de Parlamento Abierto y la Ley Orgánica de Transparencia y Acceso a la Información Pública.• Inclusión del catálogo legislativo en la web institucional, fortaleciendo el acceso a la ciudadanía a la información de la Asamblea 

¿Por qué es relevante a los valores de OGP? Participación ciudadana: involucramiento de distintos actores estatales y no estatales en la construcción del catálogo de datos abiertos legislativo, así como la definición de los mecanismos de difusión y mayor uso de los mecanismos de participación ciudadana actualmente existentes en la Asamblea Nacional fomentando un ayor involucramiento ciudadano para la cocreación legislativa. Rendición de cuenta: con el facil acceso a la información sobre la actividad legislativa en manos de la ciudadanía, se logra difundir el proceso de creación de leyes en todos los niveles o rendición de cuentas diaria de la Asamblea Nacional. Transparencia: a través de un catálogo de información legislativa, que contenga toda la actividad legislativa, se logra promover la transparencia, mejorar el acceso a la información de la ciudadanía, mediante plataformas completas y útiles. Información adicional El compromiso está vinculado con instrumentos nacionales e internacionales de planificación como la Agenda 2030, el Plan de Creación de Oportunidades 2021 - 2025 y con instrumentos normativos como la Constitución de la República.

Even though lobbying is not regulated by laws in Estonia, the studies carried out clearly refer to a need for rules. The public as well as decision-makers should have a clearer understanding of who submitted the amendment proposals or who is behind an expert opinion. Clear lobbying rules, i.e. representing interest groups must be set out. Amendments to the Riigikogu Rules of Procedure and Internal Rules Act (13.04.2016, RT I, 03.05.2016, 2) have been passed, with which the minutes of the sittings of committees are made significantly more substantial and open.

What is the public problem that the commitment will address?        In 2016, the Riigikogu Rules of Procedure and Internal Rules Act was amended, making the minutes of committee sittings more informative than before.
The State Gazette (Riigi Teataja) enables subscribing to e-mail notifications regarding all draft legislations and the stages of legislative proceeding, from coordination to publishing in the State Gazette.
In 2017, the Anti-Corruption Select Committee developed recommendations for the members of the Riigikogu on how to communicate with lobbyist and described sample situations which may occur .
Therefore, the openness of the Riigikogu has somewhat increased; however, the practice has not been harmonised between committees and problems occur with the speed of publishing information, participation in the legislative proceeding of draft legislation, and access to data regarding both web publications and open data.
What is the commitment?        In order to make the information on the web page of the Riigikogu more available and user-friendly, the web page is further developed in a manner which allows processing data related to the plenary assembly in a machine-readable format.
Publishing of minutes of committees is hastened and harmonised between committees.
How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem?        By publishing the open data, information related to legislating becomes more available and more possibilities are created to use information published by the Riigikogu.
Faster publishing of minutes makes legislating more transparent, as the public receives up-to-date information on how the decisions are formed.

What is the public problem that the commitment will address? The e-Consultation Information System (EIS) was introduced in 2011 to coordinate draft legislation between ministries and manage documents of the European Union. In addition, functioning as a participation channel is osale.ee but it is not sufficiently integrated with EIS. Thus, legislation is fragmented between different environments and the management of document versions is scattered (for example, in 2019 the Government of the Republic discussed 718 drafts and other issues). Both officials and interest groups are interested in an open platform that allows for co-creative policy-making from the earliest possible stage of the initiative. 

What is the commitment? Within the framework of Estonia’s Open Government Partnership Action Plan for 2018–2020, the terms of reference and prototype for a new information system have been developed, having passed through about a dozen pilot groups (with the participation of ministries, the Riigikogu and interest groups). This Action Plan includes the development of a text editor, the testing thereof and its implementation. The functionality of the public view of the co-creation workspace will be achieved as part of the next action plan. For Impact assessment, additional tools will be created within the framework of the development of the co-creation workspace. Compatibility with information systems previously in use in the country is kept in mind and therefore the administrative burden and duplication of data is not increased. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? As a result of the development, a comprehensive co-creative workspace will be completed, which will enable the creation and processing of draft legal acts. The platform provides an overview of the initiative from its inception to its adoption and ex-post evaluation. The transition from document-based to version-based processing will increase legislative transparency, allow for 10 greater co-creation and reduce the workload of both officials and interest groups spent preparing, updating and processing documents. A thoroughly tested text editor created during this stage of development is a prerequisite for the introduction of a public view of the co-creation environment. 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? Transparency Civic participation Additional information The activity supports the achievement of the strategic goal of ‘Estonia 2035’, in which ‘Estonia is an innovative, reliable and people-centred country’. The activity is related to the activities of the Civil Society Programme ‘Strong Civil Society’ for 2021–2024.

1.2 Pilot new co-creation methodologies and tools
What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Policy-making in Estonia is rooted in the engagement of the public, although the capacity of government authorities is uneven. Instead of engagement, the public is increasingly awaiting co-creative policy-making, which requires not only technical support (such as the development of the EIS described above) but also increased skills for officials, including engagement coordinators, which is supported by central training9 . It is therefore important to find methods that would encourage those people who have not joined any advocacy or representative organizations to participate in the process of co-creation. Greater attention must also be focused on those groups within society, whose involvement is more reserved. For example, research has shown that over a period of a few years the proportion of young people who feel that their participation is having an impact at the local level has decreased, while at the same time the proportion of young people who see their participation as contributing to national decisions has increased.10 It must also be taken into account that one in four residents of Estonia will be over the age of 65 in 2035, meaning that the usual (digital) methods of engagement will need to be reviewed. In addition, research shows that while 69% of Estonians are interested in domestic politics (63% in 2015), the level of interest is 54% among Estonian citizens of other nationalities (57% in 2015). At the same time, Estonians are also about 15 percentage points more politically active than people from other nationalities are.11 

What is the commitment? To collect and describe the best practices for co-creation and test new methodologies with a view to creating a toolbox of co-creation methods for the agency. At least two pilot projects will be carried out: Development and implementation of the ‘Estonia 2035’ Strategy Day concept (led by the 9 During the implementation of the Action Plan, central training in policy development and impact assessment (including engagement, process management and optional modules on analytical capacity) will continue for up to two hundred people per year. 10 Flash Eurobarometer 455. European Youth. September 2017. 11 The Institute of Baltic Studies, Praxis Centre for Policy Studies. Monitoring of the integration of Estonian society 2017. 12 Government Office and the Ministry of Finance) and analysis and improvement of the work of advisory bodies (Ministry of Rural Affairs). During the course of the implementation of the Action Plan, opportunities will be sought to add a third pilot project to the activity, if necessary. ● The state’s long-term development strategy ‘Estonia 2035’ is an umbrella document for development plans and related programmes in the field. The strategy implementation process envisages that the strategy day with partners and interest groups will take place once per year; however, the aim is to create an opportunity for everyone to contribute to the strategy discussions. To this end, the concept and co-creation methods will be developed in cooperation with civil society. The concept of the ‘Estonia 2035’ Strategy Day will be flexible and will allow for the testing several methods, which can then be used by other government authorities, local governments, and others. ● The aim of the pilot project of strategic partnership and advisory bodies is, based on the example of the Ministry of Rural Affairs (there are more than 15 advisory bodies in the area of governance, with more than 150 organisations participating). The aim is to analyse the practice of planning, managing and involving the work of advisory bodies and to create tools for different levels of management, in order to increase the effectiveness of cooperation between the parties and their level of satisfaction with the process. Other government agencies, local governments, etc can also use the results. In order to assess the activities, a satisfaction survey is conducted among the participants (engagement coordinators, officials from the participating ministries, representatives of non-governmental organizations). 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? The toolbox of co-creation methods will bring together existing experiences and lessons learned, and will allow for the testing of different co-creation methods. As a result, officials have the knowledge needed in order to increase both their courage as well as the skills to shape policy through co-creation (including increasing the capacity of engagement coordinators to advise policy makers in their government agencies). There will also be an increase in the knowledge base and co-creation of policy and legislation, and an improvement in the skills and knowledge of those involved (including in describing and managing expectations). Local government employees can also use the toolbox.

Within the framework of the OGP Action Plan of Georgia for 2016-2017, the administration of the GoG, in cooperation with the MoJ, initiated the development of a Unified Regulatory Impact Assessment and Monitoring System (RIA). 

The system serves the establishment of an evidence-based decision making process and implies the making of a situational analysis on the basis of ex-ante assessment. The ex-ante assessment makes it possible to identify specific problems and develop and plan legislative acts adapted thereto. 

The government’s purpose is to make the preparation of the RIA report mandatory under the current plan. It is of importance that a consultation with both the relevant experts and wide public is an integral part of ex-ante assessment. In this way the government constantly ensures citizen participation in the drafting of laws or strategic documents and, accordingly, the making of decisions adapted to their needs.

Administration of the GoG will, together with partner agencies, start in 2018 work on reforming the existing grant funding system of state/public institutions in order to ensure transparency and efficiency of the given sphere. 

To date, Georgian legislation does not provide for general principles and procedures for allocation of grants by ministries and legal entities of public law. No uniform regulatory standard for allocation of grants by public institutions exists.

Under this commitment, standards of financing for public agencies will be established and detailed principles will be written out. Administration of the GoG will, together with partner agencies, draft amendments to the Law on Grants to be considered with stakeholders and will submit it to Parliament of Georgia befor the end of 2019.

Issues to be Addressed	To date, Georgian legislation does not provide for general principles and procedures for allocation of grants by ministries and legal entities of public law. Additionally, a number of public institutions, including self-governments are not included in the public granting system.
One of the components of the present initiative implies regulatory establishment of basic standards and principles (including unbiased and participatory decision making, preliminary identmification and publication of selection criteria, avoidance of conflict of interest, process t6ransparency, etc.). These should be sufficiently clear for making the grant funding a reliable and transparent process. At that, according to these standard-principles, individual state agencies will have a possibility of a detailed arrangement of the process.
The initiative incidentally implies authorization of local self-government with the use of the grant allocation mechanism, which shall, in a number of cases, facilitate better fulfillment of functions, encouragement of inter-municipal initiatives, active citizen participation in this process and on-site encouragement of different initiatives.
Main Objective	Reforming the existing system of grant allocation by the state/public institutions; increasing its transparency, accessibility and efficiency.

 Current Situation and Challenges  In order to establish efficient, effective and accountable budget system, it is crucial to ensure citizen involvement in budgetary processes. 
 According to the Open Budget Survey conducted within the framework of International Budget Partnership (IBP) in 2017, Georgia took the fifth place. Despite receiving high rating in accordance with a number of criterions (80 Points/OBI 2017), the country is still challenged with a low rating (22 Points/OBI 2017) for the criterion of Citizen Involvement in Budgetary Processes. 
 The nature of the budget process requires that certain activities involve joint effort of key organizations that participate in the process, including coordination and implementation of Parliamentary control on performed activities.

 Current Situation and Challenges The Department of Case Management of the Parliament of Georgia, which is composed of several structural units, is tasked with ensuring uniform case management of the Parliament Bureau, citizen reception, registration of their letters and other appeals and transferring them to relevant addressees.
 The constitutional amendments and the new Rules of Procedure of the Parliament that will enter into force in November 2018 will increase the Parliament's oversight function. This constitutes a challenge that the Parliament Bureau must tackle through a new approach.
 Article 1, Paragraphs f) and g) of the draft Rules of Procedure determine the following principles of parliamentary work: openness, transparency and accessibility. The principle of good governance and the Sustainable Development Goal 16 are also being fully reflected in parliamentary activities.
 To tackle existing challenges, the Parliament must establish a Citizen Engagement Center that will offer new services to citizens in terms of staying informed about and taking part in parliamentary activities. The Center will also provide adapted services for vulnerable citizens and those with special needs.

 Current Situation and Challenges A large part of the public in Georgia is not fully informed about the activities of the Parliament and its systemic reforms. This greatly impedes the establishment of democratic and inclusive governance. To solve this problem, the Parliament of Georgia must develop a communication strategy involving the organization of various events, such as information campaigns and public meetings, use of social networks (e.g. Facebook) and production of informational materials. An awareness raising campaign on parliamentary activities will promote the formation of an informed society and more active citizen engagement in the lawmaking process. This will also significantly increase public trust towards the legislative authority.

DE0030,Germany,3,1,DEU,Europe,National,1,2021,2023,2,NA,A foundation for improving access to legal information,A foundation for improving access to legal information,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? The legislative information provided free of charge by the Federal Government is current-ly spread across three different portals: Gesetze-im-Internet (laws), Rechtsprechung-im-Internet (jurisprudence) and Verwaltungsvorschriften-im-Internet (administrative regu-lations). The legislative information that is accessible to the public is limited to currently applicable federal law, federal case-law from 2010 onwards, and current federal adminis-trative regulations. There is little metadata for the documents, so the portals’ search func-tionality is also restricted. Furthermore, technical access to this information lags behind the current standard, and civil society actors and businesses face considerable practical obsta-cles to their own use of the data in leading-edge applications. There is a great deal of time and effort involved in preparing the data for automated selection and processing. Other countries already offer more modern and more user-friendly legislative information portals. 

What is the commitment? The Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection (BMJV) will develop the vision of a uniform, contemporary legislative information portal that is intuitive, accessible and user friendly. The portal is intended to provide the general public with a significantly broader range of legislative information from the Federal Government in future. The documents, including comprehensive metadata, will be made available as open data for the first time. To achieve this, the Federal Government will do the technical groundwork for its own data repository that in time will also feed into the portal. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? The vision of the legislative information portal and the associated application programming interface (API) will be conceived and developed in an open, transparent, agile and user-cen-tric process. The API should allow citizens, civil society, the scientific and academic com-munity and businesses (such as start-ups) to process the data outside of the portal for both personal and commercial purposes, enabling them to offer innovative products and ser-vices. The project outcomes are to be made available to the public on a dedicated website. This will present the target vision for the legislative information portal in the form of a click dummy, accompanied by descriptions and explanations. The API documentation will also be published and a “request for comment” format set up to collect technical feedback on the interface. There are also plans to put a live and active, but functionally limited version of the API on the website. Interested parties can then test and experiment with it using a lim-ited and out-of-date dataset. The target group here – consisting of businesses, students, the scientific and academic community, civil society and private individuals – is extremely mixed, and the project a very complex one. Public participation is therefore needed to en-sure that the portal will generate real added value for all, and that the technical and func-tional requirements of potential downstream users are factored into interface development.

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? This commitment creates a high degree of transparency by offering an unprecedented scope of legislative information from the Federal Government. It does so free of charge in a machine-readable format via a standard interface and a user-centric platform. In addition to transparency, participation and inclusion, the agile approach chosen for this commit-ment, and the close involvement of users and the public, also addresses how technology and innovation can be harnessed in the interests of open access. 

Additional information Measures set out in the Data Strategy of 27 January 2021. The legislative information portal will not go live until after the implementation period for this Action Plan. Sustainable Development Goals: SDG 16 (Peace, justice and strong institutions)

The Joint Ministerial Gazette (Gemeinsames Ministerialblatt, GMBl) is the official publication of the Federal Government. It is published by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community (BMI). The GMBl is not the only way to access the administrative and other regulations, directives, decrees, orders, circulars and announcements published in it by the federal ministries. The different departments and authorities will also provide informa-tion and/or access free of charge upon request. To date, various libraries have offered free access to the GMBl, but otherwise, paid access is available from the publisher for individual editions and online access subscriptions. 

What is the commitment? In the future, the BMI would like to develop the current system to provide particularly citizen-friendly access. In the interests of transparency and maximum accessibility where federal legislation is concerned, going forward GMBl content should therefore be available largely free of charge and in digital format. A concept is being drawn up that will also provide simple, free online access to content. It is scheduled for implementation by the end of 2024. 

How does the commitment contribute to overcoming the challenge? By reconfiguring information access points, the BMI is making a key contribution to ensur-ing largely free and easy public access to this component of Federal Government legislation, thereby reflecting the core principle of open government 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?This commitment gives a broader public easier access to information, largely free of charge. It therefore helps to make the actions of the federal administration more transparent.

Additional information The timetable is still subject to a variety of factors, and implementation is unlikely to be completed before the end of the period covered by the third NAP.

GR0084,Greece,5,2,GRC,Europe,National,1,2022,2024,2,NA,Plenary & Committee Minutes,Access to Plenary and Committee Minutes,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

Upgrading the way the plenary and committee minutes are released and presented so as to provide faster and more complete information to the public as per the parliamentary process, the activity of the MPs and the legislative procedure.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? The commitment aims to address a chronic problem pertaining to the lack of proper indexing (subject, speaker etc) of the minutes of the Committees as well as the format of their storage that made the relevant information difficult to access. This also hindered the proper interconnection of the Committee minutes with the rest of the Parliament’s legislative archive (Plenary minutes, legislation etc). 

2. What are the causes of the problem? The root cause of the problem is that different services following different methods were responsible for releasing the minutes of the Plenary and the Committees. As a result the Committee minutes were not properly indexed. 

Commitment Description

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? The issue hadn’t been tackled previously. 

2. What solution are you proposing? All indexing will take place by a single unit so as to guarantee homogeneity in the process. We also aim to introduce the Eurovoc thesaurus instead of our in-house thematic catalogue so as for indexing to follow internationally recognized standards. We aim to expand indexing to the Committee minutes. We aim to improve the interconnectivity between the various sections of the Parliament’s legislative archive. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? Our main goal is to enhance the transparency of the parliamentary process by facilitating easier and more thorough access to the minutes of both the Plenary and the Committees. By linking the latter to the legislative output we also aim to offer in the near future the ability for interested parties to obtain all relevant information regarding the preparation, debate and vote of every legislative act through a one-stop-shop service. 

Commitment Analysis 

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? Minutes will be hereafter properly indexed according to subject, date and speaker making them easily retrievable via the website’s search engine. Interested parties will be able thus to gain faster and easier access to the data regarding the work of the MPs, the debate inside the Committees etc. 

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? Easy and thorough access to the Committee hearings, the Plenary and the legislative archive of the Parliament enhances public scrutiny over the MPs work and the quality of the legislative process and thus fosters accountability. 

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? N/A

Commitment Description
Lead implementing
agency/actor
Ministry of Home Affairs
Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 12/2011
article 96 act 1 on the Establishment of Legislation
mentions that “people have right to provide input orally
and/or written in the Establishment on Legislation” in
which Local Regulation in Provinces and Districts are
included in the legislation hierarchy. It is stated that
people have the right to participate in the process of
developing the regulation as the requirement of the
democratic policy. However, there are still some
factors that obstruct people’s opportunity to participate
in forming local regulation. The main factors are lack
of access to the process and minimum facility
available. Breakthrough is needed to empower
people’s role in the development of local regulation.
What is the public problem that
the commitment will address?
The commitment of E-Legislation portal is not a new
innovation because it is already implemented in
Semarang and Makassar. For replicating reason, the
purpose of this commitment is to accelerate the use of
E-Legislation in other regions. The portal contains
legislative programs, drafts of the new regulation,
discussion agendas, minutes of the meeting and online
public consultation menu.
What is the commitment?
The openness of the law-making process through
E-Legislation portal will benefit the society’s needs in
so many levels, such as the information of the process
of developing the regulation, the Regional House of
Representative activities, and online public
consultation menu. Moreover, this platform will be
user-friendly designed.
How will the commitment
contribute to solve the public
problem?
The commitment is aligned with some of Open
Government Partnership (OGP) values which are civic
participation and transparency.
Why is this commitment relevant
to OGP values?
25 Indonesia Open Government Partnership National Action Plan 2018-2020
On this commitment, the Ministry of Home Affairs
has to issue circular letters to the Secretariat of the
Regional House of Representative. In parallel, the
ministry will develop the E-Legislation platform in the
regions. This platform will provide the bill documents,
comment box and the issuance of regulation in the
regional level. ● Civic participation is related to the openness in the
decision-making process involving people
extensively from various background. In this case,
by providing an E-Legislation platform to uphold
democratic space in the local regulation
making-process, the government has manifested
the value of civic participation.
● Transparency is related to the quality of public
information and people access the information.
This value is manifested in the e-Legislation which
enable people to access the proposed regional
regulation.
The commitment is also aligned with achievement
effort of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
number 16: “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies
for sustainable development, provide access to justice
for all and effective, accountable and inclusive
institution at all levels”, especially on target 16.7:
“Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory, and
representative decision-making at all levels”.
Participatory decision-making process up to the
regional level can create an inclusive and peaceful
society for sustainable development in Indonesia.

The public still finds difficulty in obtaining complete and online legislation information directly from the source at DPR RI. The results of the 2020-2024 OPI Roadmap Survey conducted from July to August 2020 held by Secretariat General of DPR RI, IPC and WFD found that the majority of respondents acquire information on parliament and legislation through secondary sources such as online news media and social media. This resulted in the circulation of misinformation about parliament, including information on legislation in the public. It is a major obligation for the DPR RI based on Law Number 14 of 2008 on Public Information Openness (KIP) to provide all public information and to become the single source of truth for legislative information. In The National Action Plan for Open Parliament Indonesia (OPI) 2018-2020, the Indonesian Parliament has established a Legislation Information System (SILEG) (Link http://www.dpr.go.id/uu/prolegnas-long-list) which serves to present legislative information that is up to date and easily accessible to all people. SILEG uses railway legislation design which is integrated with the main website of DPR RI (Link http://www.dpr.go.id/) intended so that the public can easily follow the passage of legislation. However, the SILEG platform, which is integrated on the main DPR RI website, is still not equipped with various information and data crucial for the public. The information includes among others detailed explanation of the stages of the draft law 76 process and standardisation of legislative documents uploaded in the system. In addition, even though SILEG already has a service that provides access to participation for people who want to provide input and aspirations in the legislation process via email to the Legislation Body through email set_baleg@dpr.go.id. However, this system has not been running optimally in various ways. First is the lack of response and follow-up to the public. Second is dissemination to the community is still lacking, so that people are still unfamiliar with the system. This resulted in disconnection and miscommunication between the parliament and the public in the legislative process. What is the commitment? Increasing the capacity of the Legislative Information System (SILEG) in presenting legislative information that is more complete and simpler for the public to understand. Improvements have also been made to the speed, accuracy and up-to-dateness of the presentation of legislative information, as well as improving the quality of the more responsive public participation channels on SILEG. Milestone: 1. Determination of standard data formats and types of legislative information documents (minutes, legislation documents). 2. Improvement of quality of human resources related in legislative information through training and workshops. 3. Formulation of the SILEG Implementation Guidelines which regulate: a. Procedure for treatise publication b. Document type and format c. Accuracy of data upload time d. Monitoring and evaluation of SILEG management 4. Development of a public participation channel system in the SILEG application 77 How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? This commitment will provide the public with a more complete, fast and accurate legislation information platform. This commitment will also expand access to public participation in the legislative process. Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? This commitment improves access to information for the public by providing more standardised information, organised publication procedures and better-quality human resources. So that this contributes to the value of transparency. This commitment will also open up opportunities for the public to channel their aspirations and inputs to the ongoing legislation and this will contribute to the value of public participation. Conformity with the Parliament Work Plan 1. DPR RI Strategic Plan for 2020-2024 2.

ID0130,Indonesia,6,20,IDN,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Akses Publik terhadap Informasi Digital Parlemen dalam Format Open Data,Create digital platform for open parliament data,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Inadequate availability of information in accordance with public needs has resulted in the public preferring to access information from online media and social media as opposed to information presented directly by DPR RI. Minimal use of internet-based Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the parliament has also resulted in limited opportunity for digital collaboration and public participation. These two problems are in line with the results of the 2020- 2024 OPI Roadmap Survey conducted from July to August 2020 which found that the majority of respondents received information from conventional and online mass media and not from media or websites owned by DPR RI. Therefore, it is necessary to access parliamentary data and information based on information technology and documentation that is more structured, open and interoperable through the development of Big Data infrastructure in accordance with Open Data standards for the public. In the future, the public will no longer need to have trouble finding information about legislation and parliament from other sources because all of them are provided by DPR RI. What is the commitment? Development of Parliamentary Big Data. This commitment will be implemented long term and continuously. Milestone : 1. Preparation of Parliamentary Big Data Infrastructure 2. Development of the Parliamentary Data and Video Network (PDVN). 3. Adjustment of data format standards and parliamentary documents according to Open Data standards. 80 4. Website Redesign www.dpr.go.id 5. Governance guidelines on information services and public information lists. 6. Development of Budget Information System Modeling (Singgar), Supervision Information System (Sinwas). How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? Parliamentary Big Data is a unified data management system from the production process, authorization, digitization to publication in the open data format. This commitment aims to provide easier, more open and interoperable access to parliamentary information and data for the public. As one of the national knowledge centers, through this commitment, DPR RI is expected to be the main source of data and information for everything related to legislation and parliament. Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? This commitment will increase the amount of data and information that can be accessed by the public. In addition, information will be made in a more integrated, interoperable and open manner in accordance with Open Data standards. Thus, this commitment contributes to the values of transparency. Conformity with the Parliament Work Plan ● Information and Communication Technology Master Plan of DPR RI (RITIK) ● DPR RI Strategic Plan for 2020-2024 ● This formation is in line with DPR RI’s plan to initiate a “Modern Parliament,” namely a parliament that is representative, transparent and uses information technology.

ID0131,Indonesia,6,21,IDN,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Strengthening Information System for Members of Parliament (SIAP),Provide public access to information on members of parliament,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? The public still has difficulty getting information about every member of DPR RI who is currently serving in the Parliament. Information on members is the right of the community as constituents to find out information about their representatives. Member information is a form of parliamentary accountability to the public. And it is imperative for the public to obtain comprehensive information of parliament members who represent their interests. On the main DPR RI Website (www.dpr.go.id) through the webpage http://www.dpr.go.id/anggota/index/, a page is available for each member to present information ranging from profiles, biographies, constituencies, activities agendas, photo galleries, documents, guest books and contacts. Members are also given access to integrate all communication platforms such as blogs, websites, social media on that page. However, the required data were not completed, so the public is not well informed and tends to use external information to obtain information on members. What is the commitment? Increasing the capacity of the information system for each member of DPR RI through the official website of DPR RI Milestone: 1. Guidelines for information standards and publications of DPR members with constituents which include: a. Profiles of members of DPR RI b. Recess Information 84 2. Member Information System Channel (integrated in the website redesign process). 3. Strengthening the capacity of Expert Staff and Member Administration Staff in increasing information on members both in the Electoral District and in DPR RI. How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? This commitment will provide more complete, informative, accurate and up to date information on each member of DPR RI as a form of parliamentary accountability to the public at large. Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? This commitment will provide the public with access to information that is more transparent, broad and up to date regarding each member of DPR RI. This is a form of accountability of Members of Parliament to their constituents and the public who are also the targets of legislation drafted by members so this commitment contributes to continuing to promote the values of transparency and accountability.

DPR RI already has various channels of public participation both online such as Public Participation in Legislative Views (SIMAS PUU), Aspiration Houses, and Public Complaints, as well as offline such as Public Hearings (RDPU), audiences and direct visits. RDPU is a formal public consultation mechanism provided by DPR RI by inviting speakers from community organisations, academics or practitioners. However, in various channels, especially offline, active participation from the public is still limited and engagement between parliament and the community has been far from ideal. Moreover, DPR RI does not yet have a regular forum where requests are centered on the public. Access to public participation also remains limited since not all requests for hearings can be fulfilled and activities such as visits and public hearings are only limited to invitations determined by the commission. Therefore, additional space and opportunity for more dialogbased participation is needed outside the existing mechanisms that can reach various interest groups in society with specific and in-depth themes. As a legislative institution that represents the people and their interests, DPR RI needs to have a multi-party forum that focuses on the substance of policies and legislation and is held continuously and periodically. This forum can also be used by DPR RI to give attention to crucial issues that exist in society, as well as an opportunity to build a stronger relationship with various stakeholders in the society. 87 What is the commitment? Forming a multi-stakeholder forum between DPR RI and the community and for regular policy dialog. Milestone: 1. Formulation of standards for the implementation of multi-stakeholder forums which include: a. Thematic priority category b. Mechanism for implementing multistakeholder forums 2. Public participationmanagement assessment How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? This commitment aims to build a wider space for dialog between DPR RI and the public that has been very limited and complex to date. It is expected that a consistent and sustainable substantive forum can be a good starting platform for building a two-way dialog between DPR RI and the public. Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? This commitment will seek to open a wider space for public participation to discuss various aspects of issues and substance in parliament. Through periodic multi-stakeholder forums, the public can not only convey their input and aspirations, the parliament will also include and respond to various issues presented by the community, as a form of accountability of DPR RI to the public. Therefore, this commitment includes the value of participation and accountability. Conformity with the Parliament Work Plan 1. DPR RI Strategic Plan for 2020-2024 2.

ID0133,Indonesia,6,23,IDN,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Promosi Inovasi Keterbukaan Parlemen,Use journalists and media to promote innovations in parliamentary openness,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? DPR RI has developed various platforms and applications for parliamentary openness to the public, including the Legislation Information System (SILEG), E-PPID, Rumah Aspirasi, SIMAS PUU and others. However, there are still many people who are not informed yet about this application and have not been informed about how it works and how the application has been developed by the parliament. DPR RI has made numerous efforts to disseminate these products and innovations, but it is not yet received a significant response from the public. For this reason, a new approach is called for to disseminate various innovations in parliamentary openness. This new approach takes the form of developing a more proactive media engagement and developing data driven journalism. This engagement aims not only to introduce parliamentary applications and information but also to provide opportunities for media crews in processing parliamentary information in accordance with journalism's objectives. Journalists and the media have wider outreach to the general public compared to parliament. The media also have various communication assets and strategies that are more creative and capable of attracting people's attention so that the involvement of the parliament with journalists and the media is crucial to promote the various applications and platforms of parliamentary openness to the public. Journalists and media crews have become partners who are consistently present in the parliament. However, their presence only covers the reporting of legislation and members of DPR RI and the implementation of DPR RI functions which have received wide public attention. Not many have covered DPR RI’s innovative product innovations, especially how it works and the services provided to the public. 90 The media have various communication assets and strategies that are more creative and capable of attracting people's attention so that the involvement of the parliament with journalists and the media is needed to promote the various applications and platforms of parliamentary openness to the public. What is the commitment? Promoting and disseminating information on various innovations in parliamentary openness to the public by involving journalists and the media. Milestone: 1. Formulating guidelines for the use of various applications and information systems for DPR RI for the public 2. Developing media for the promotion of parliamentary openness innovation campaigns (print advertising, digital advertising, video / animation, social media 3. Media engagement and outreach a. Data Journalism Hackathon b. Media Meeting and Visit c. Workshop on Media and Parliament d. Parliament Openness Innovation Competition How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? This commitment will encourage engagement and cooperation between parliament and journalists and the media to promote various products and innovations of openness to the public. Through this commitment, it is hoped that the parliament can reach a wider range of people who do not yet know the function and workings of the parliamentary openness application and platform they need. This collaboration is also expected to produce various forms of manuals or guidelines for the use of applications and innovative platforms for parliamentary openness such as infographics, comics, animations and videos that are much more interesting and communicative to the public. Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? This commitment will bridge the function of journalists and media with DPR-RI to jointly support the Parliamentary Openness by promoting various innovations in parliamentary 91 openness through various collaborative activities. For this reason, the values covered are participation and innovation. Conformity with the Parliament Work Plan 4. DPR RI Strategic Plan for 2020-2024 5.

In the 2018-2020 National Action Plan for the Openness of the Indonesian Parliament (OPI), DPR RI has formed the OPI Team as the main instrument in implementing OPI NAP. This team consists of DPR RI Leadership / Members assisted by DPR RI Secretariat General, as well as representatives of civil society. The OPI team and Secretariat General of the DPR RI will ensure that the NAP OPI is implemented and has budget and adequate supporting resources. However, there are still some aspects that have not been achieved, including the management of the OPI Team, the Secretariat and the External Open Parliament Community (CSOs, IO and non parliamentary stakeholders) , building a repository in accordance with OGP standards and strengthening the OPI work unit. These aspects are crucial to ensure that the implementation of the Openness of Parliament can run smoothly. What is the commitment? Increasing the capacity and performance of the Open Parliament Indonesia (OPI) Team and Secretariat consisting of DPR RI Leaders / Members, Secretariat General, and representatives of civil society in accordance with OGP standards and provisions. Milestone: 1. Strengthening the OPI Work Unit (Team and Secretariat) by assigning a Support Unit for the Secretariat General according to OGP standards 2. Strengthening OPI Cooperation with CSOs and outside stakeholders 3. Developing OPI repository 94 4. Peer Learning Forum(s) Open MPs Information, Transparency and Accountability 5. Formulating a governance mechanism for the OPI Team, Secretariat and the External Open Parliament Community 6. Feasibility Study on DPR RI Call Center Services in two years term. How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? Public demand for the parliament that is increasingly transparent and participatory is getting higher amid the rapid development of information and technology. For this reason, DPR RI needs to strengthen various internal aspects that can support and improve their performance both in terms of systems, bureaucracy, human resources, providing facilities and infrastructure for a more open parliament. Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? This commitment will improve the capacity of DPR RI in community participation and co-creation in building an increasingly open parliament. At the same time, involvement of the public in the Open Parliament structure will increase the transparency and accountability of parliament to the public. Conformity with the Parliament Work Plan 1.

Currently, there is a “black hole” that lies between the stage at which a digital memorandum is circulated by a government ministry and the stage at which a government bill is placed before the Knesset ahead of its first reading. The process of distributing memoranda of laws is managed by the government, in the internal system of the memoranda of laws website and is presented to the public on the government legislation website (where government legislative initiatives, drafts of secondary legislation and are presented). The bills are presented in the National Legislation Database only after they are presented for a first reading. The public is not presented with information about the memorandum at the stage following its circulation on the government legislation website. There is however no connection between the memorandum circulated and the bill that is finally placed before the Knesset. Thus, it is difficult to know whether the legislative process in the Knesset has commenced with regard to a particular government memorandum, and it is difficult to locate the text of the memorandum as it was circulated, and the public comments received regarding a bill or law originating in a government memorandum. Users have to search for the information on both sites – the government legislative website and the National Legislation Database, without there being a common thread between the memorandum and the subsequent bill. In addition, passing of secondary legislative initiatives that require Knesset involvement are transmitted from government ministries to the Knesset by email, without their process in the government or the Knesset being presented to the general public.

What is the commitment?

Optimization Creating an interface between the government and the Knesset to ensure that every government bill placed before the Knesset table will be linked to the memorandum of law that the government circulated for public comment on the “Government Legislation Website.” Presentation of bills in the National Legislation Database will enable comments from the public on the memorandum and their presentation on the database’s website. The goal is to present the public with a full picture of the legislative process, which encompasses the government steps prior to the Knesset and up to presentation before the Knesset.of the reporting process and supervision and analysis of data: The interface for managing government legislation in the internal system of the Knesset will make it possible to submit inquiries from government ministries to the Knesset about proposals to initiate secondary legislation by the government. Passing secondary legislation requires the involvement of the Knesset. Procedures required by law, such as obtaining the consent or consultation of ministers in formulating versions of secondary legislation will be conducted within the internal government system – these include the agreement or consultation of ministers in formulating the drafts of secondary legislation and information on their implementation will be transferred to the Knesset. At the same time, the Knesset will act to promote the presentation of the legislative process for secondary legislation, which requires Knesset approval in order to enact it, in such a way that the process in the Knesset will be presented to the public.

How will the commitment address the problem?

The Ministry of Justice and the Knesset will work to create a mutual interface for the transfer of information between them. This will create a precise digital link in the legislative process of government bills, from the stage they are initiated by the government initiation and continuing through the legislative process in the Knesset, and the same will apply to secondary legislation whose legislative process requires Knesset approval.

Why is the commitment relevant to OGP?

The commitment is relevant to the OGP because it increases transparency regarding government legislative initiatives through the presentation of information regarding their passage through the Knesset and the commencement of the legislative process. In addition, the commitment will make it possible to locate information on bills that are going through legislative process, and to locate the wording of memoranda and public comments in relation to the memoranda on the government legislation website. The commitment will lead to the information on the process of passing secondary legislation, which until now has not been exposed to the public at the stage of passage through the Knesset, will be presented to the public in such a way that information about all the stages of legislation and relevant documents will be open to public scrutiny.

How does the commitment contribute to inclusion and equality?

Some of the bills and secondary legislation also deal with inclusion and equality, and therefore increasing transparency and information about the legislative process of government initiatives is useful in this area as well.

The full and up-to-date version of the laws of the State of Israel is not currently displayed to the public by any official state body, but by commercial entities only. The National Legislation Database, established by the Knesset and launched in December 2014, displays information on all the laws enacted in the country and all the amendments enacted to these laws. For each law, an up-to-date and complete version is presented as a link to the Open Law Book – a project of a civil society entity and the Public Knowledge Workshop. However, there is great importance to a state entity preparing and presenting to the public free of charge the updated and full version of the laws, including all amendments amended to them by primary or secondary legislation.

What is the commitment?

The Knesset is working to develop a presentation of the current and complete version of the country’s laws in the National Legislation Database. The presentation will enable location of the full drafts of laws and to conduct a search of the text. With this commitment, we will formulate and develop the presentation of a timeline for each law, on which the versions of the law will be presented for each point-in-time – before amendment and after amendment (point in time legislation). The Knesset is working to prepare a full and up-to-date version of the laws of the state, which will include all information about the amendments amended to them over the years and the provisions established in relation to these amendments.

How will the commitment address the problem?

The Knesset will act to present the versions of the laws in the legislative database, and to build an interface for locating the laws and conducting a search within the texts of the laws.

Why is the commitment relevant to OGP?

The commitment is relevant to the OGP because it increases transparency and the public’s access to the versions of laws that determine norms for citizens.

How does the commitment contribute to inclusion and equality?

Some of the laws deal with inclusion and equality and thus increasing transparency and information is of use in this area as well.

General objective Value the institutional work of decision-makers by turning the Municipal Council, City Board and City Districts in the main places for participation. Current situation The City of Milan developed a number of initiatives on transparency and participation in the last few years, including the updated Statute of Municipal Regulations, new forms of citizens’ initiative that can be activated online, new guidelines on participatory urban planning and a pilot project on participatory budgeting. The website of the City of Milan was recently renovated and it has become more usable. However, all these initiatives are still graphically and organizationally disseminated in autonomous areas and often lack coordination. For example, services like the directory and activities of councilors, the information currently included in the “Transparent Administration” section, in the official noticeboard, in the communication areas, in the web streaming service and in the intranet, should be brought together and strengthened using evaluation tools that are not available yet. Expected results The reorganization of content and the benchmarking of activities allow citizens to learn about the action of institutional bodies by turning them into the main places for participation and foster the interaction and involvement of citizens with their elected or appointed representatives. Learning about the ongoing activities and procedures will help ensure transparency, organize citizens’ initiatives and data retrieval that retrace the historical perspective and background of lawmaking and scrutiny of institutional bodies. The reference model is the system already used on the web sites of the European Parliament and the Italian Parliament. More specifically, the public registry of elected representatives will include: 1. A complete overview of their participation in institutional proceedings or representing the institutions (committees, municipal council, city board meetings, participation in local or interinstitutional meetings); 2. Votes expressed on any decision adopted by the Municipal Council or City Board; 3. Legislation and draft legislation submitted to the Council and their development until completion (questions, motions, agendas, draft decisions, amendments); 4.

We will work together to improve public participation in development
decision making for better and responsive service delivery
Objective:
To operationalize the Constitutional requirement of public participation on all
matters of policy, decision making and service delivery in Kenya.
Status quo:
We currently do not have a public participation legislation at national level that
provide a general framework for effective public participation as per our
constitutional principles of democracy and participation of the people. Public
participation process is often unstructured and undertaken in a manner that is
contrary to the principles of democracy. There is also little capacity building on
the citizens to enable them engage in the process from an informed, structured
and meaningful way. More often, the process is perceived as expensive, tedious
and time consuming. Citizens are often ill informed when participating in public
forums, thereby compromising the quality of their participation.
Ambition
Design a whole-of-government program that supports meaningful, open, public
participation into National and County Governments and empowers oversight
bodies to hold Governments to Account. More specifically, Public participation in
budget sector hearings by the National Government will be more open and
inclusive. Progressively these hearings should be more open to a larger number
of stakeholders and be held at the county level as well. This was also a key ask
in the Budget and Appropriations Committee report on the budget estimates for
2018/19.

The commitment broadly aims to enhance transparency, inclusion, public participation, and accountability in legislative, debt, and budget processes, with a view of building open and trusting relations between lawmakers and citizens at both national and county levels.

Problem Definition 

Public participation and access to information are central tenets provided in the Constitution as means of enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusion. Whilst this has been implemented, public participation remains problematic, without a defined framework for ensuring its meaningfulness. Timelines given are usually too short, there is no mechanism to confirm that public input has been considered into the bills, and it is not possible to disaggregate public participation data in terms of different demographics such as gender/age/region. Additionally, information shared for public participation at both levels of government is usually complex and bulky. The process is also more consultative and not collaborative as people do not really shape the conservation and there is no feedback mechanism stipulated. On the issues of fiscal transparency, the public debt process has been opaque, with Parliament’s role being bypassed and with minimal participation from stakeholders. The commitment seeks to strengthen the role of Parliament in the process as well as provide for public participation and robust citizen engagement in the process, including ensuring that public debt is always considered in the budget process. Finally, the commitment seeks to make government agencies simplify the information and documents being shared to enhance broader stakeholder engagement through the use of plain text as well as inclusive language, as well as automation of processes, including on digital platforms. The commitment seeks to address these challenges going beyond public participation to also enhance public oversight and accountability, especially around public debts and budgets. 

What are the causes of the problem? 

● Lack of national legislation that facilitates a meaningful public participation framework. ● Violation of the law that stipulates mechanisms to engage the public through Parliament in the acquisition and use of public debt. ● Minimum proactive sharing of information on public debt including to Parliament leading to opaqueness. ● Lack of proper framework on debt management that includes the short- and long-term impact of debt to various segments of the population such as Special Interests Groups. ● There is a requirement to operationalize the PBO Act, 2013 to safeguard the civic space and the working environment for Civil Society Organizations. ● Lack of ownership of public participation commitments by different government agencies ● Lack of adequate resources to implement the commitments. 

Commitment Description 

Creation of the necessary legislative framework for public participation is at the core of realizing meaningful public participation. During the last Action Plan, attempts were made to enact a Public Participation Law but this did not succeed. Automation of legislative processes including the development of a petition tracker was also achieved but this has not resulted into effective consideration of the same. On the issue of Fiscal Transparency, increased civil society agitation on the need for public debt transparency brought the issues to the fore of national discourse. The propose milestones under NAP V will therefore be aimed at leveraging on this background whilst aiming for more ambitious and innovative means of enhancing legislative and fiscal transparency. The Commitment will further leverage on the renewed efforts at enacting a public participation law, establishment of a Public Dand Privation Committee and renewed Civil Society efforts to entrench fiscal transparency. 

Proposed Solutions 

This commitment aims to significantly expand transparency, accountability, and participatory mechanisms in governance processes and public finance management through comprehensive legislative and policy changes. It builds upon previous initiatives but goes further in scope and depth. Some key solutions proposed include legislated requirements for open public hearings on government loans, frameworks enabling citizens to provide direct input into legislation and budgets, publishing documents in accessible plain language, developing online public consultation portals, strengthened public debt oversight bodies, and empowering the Parliamentary Budget Office to produce alternative budget proposals. 

Desired Results 

The expected results are sustainable, systemic changes leading to open, participatory and accountable legislative, budgetary and debt processes. The public will be informed and empowered to provide input into budgets and legislation affecting them. The government will justify and be answerable for fiscal decisions and loans. Legislators will become more accessible and engaged with constituents. The Parliamentary Budget Office will provide rigorous analysis and alternative proposals. Overall, this commitment aims to shift legislative and fiscal processes from closed government activities with minimal disclosure, to open public processes with engaged citizen collaboration and oversight. 

Commitment Analysis 

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? The commitment will significantly improve transparency in legislative, budgetary, and debt processes by introducing public scrutiny through measures such as requiring open hearings on public loans. This will enable the public to access more information on how much is borrowed and how the money is spent. Automating parliamentary processes and providing documents in plain language will also increase transparency. 

2. How will commitment help foster accountability? By opening up these previously closed-door processes to public input and monitoring, the commitment will enable citizens and civil society organizations to hold the government accountable. Public agencies involved in legislative, budgetary, and debt processes will have to justify their actions and spending to the public. The inclusion of transparency and accountability measures will further institutionalize greater accountability mechanisms. 

3. How will commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? The commitment provides clear frameworks, requirements, and mechanisms for substantive public participation in defining, shaping, and overseeing legislative, budgetary, and debt processes. This enables citizens to collaboratively engage in policy making rather than just be passively consulted. Citizens will be able to directly give input on legislation and budgets, and track spending and outcomes. This facilitates a two-way dialogue between citizens and government with citizen voices integral to decision making.

Commitment description
What is the public problem that the commitment will
address?

The Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Normative and
Legal Acts” dated July 20, 2009 № 241 establishes
requirements for public discussion of draft normative
and legal acts (hereinafter referred to as the NLA).
Practice showed that the provisions of the Law on
public discussions are ineffective and do not ensure
the actual participation of citizens in the legislative
process due to the following reasons:
- Absence of public planning of law-making process;
- Regulations do not prescribe consideration of
alternative options at the early stage of law - making
and do not prescribe any regulating methods;
- Absence of notification mechanism of stakeholders
results in citizens incurring high costs while searching
for the information of interest on the draft NLAs;
- Absence of public mechanism to respond to
stakeholder comments;
- Absence of unified procedures that reflect the
principles of public discussions of the NLAs.

What is the commitment? The procedures of public discussions will be
improved to ensure the actual participation of
citizens in the legislative process, which will lead
to the improved quality of adopted laws and other
normative legal acts.
A unified portal for all drafted normative acts will
be created, which will allow citizens of the Kyrgyz
Republic to leave their comments.

How will the commitment contribute to the
resolution of the public problem?
The unified portal for public discussions of the draft
normative acts will facilitate access of the citizens to
timely information on the planned acts and provide
opportunities for feedback.

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? Transparency: Citizens’ ability to influence the
legislative process
Civic participation: regulation of civic participation in
the discussion of draft normative and legal acts and
state programs

Republic for 2018 - 2040” aims to establish

Commitment description
What is the public problem that the commitment will address?
Being a representative body of all sectors of society,
the Parliament represents the interests of all local
communities in the country. However, there are no
formalized and effective mechanisms to ensure the
coherence of interests of local communities with
interests of other parties in the Kyrgyz Republic.
Local communities and local self-governments do not
have a channel for the direct communication with the
Jogorku Kenesh to discuss the balance of interests in
respect to planned legislative decisions.
What is the commitment? Establishment of effective mechanisms of interaction
between the local community, local self-governments
and the Jogorku Kenesh of the Kyrgyz Republic will
allow inclusion of interests of LSGs in adoption of the
NLAs. 

How will the commitment contribute to the resolution of the public problem?
Establishment of mechanisms for communicating
the needs and interests of local communities to the
Jogorku Kenesh will ensure the strengthening of the
accountability of the Parliament, as the Jogorku Kenesh
will take into account the interests of local communities
in the adoption of relevant policy decisions (NLAs),
and will also provide favorable conditions for the LSG
bodies to effectively engage in the dialogue with the
Jogorku Kenesh in the process of discussing draft laws
related to the interests of local communities.
Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? Participation of citizens: Ensured active participation
of local communities and LSGs in the discussion of
some draft NLAs and national strategic documents
affecting their interests.

Commitment description

What is the public problem that the commitment will address?
Despite the fact that according to the Rules of Procedure
of the Jogorku Kenesh of the Kyrgyz Republic the
following provisions were drafted and adopted: “On the
procedure of presence of citizens and representatives
of legal entities at the meetings of the Jogorku Kenesh
of the Kyrgyz Republic and its bodies”; “On the use of
buildings, structures, residential office premises and
territories under the jurisdiction of the Jogorku Kenesh
the Kyrgyz Republic”; “On the permit regime” the access
of information about these procedures to the citizens
(Rules of Procedure, Article 145) and the admission
of citizens to the premises of the Jogorku Kenesh of
the Kyrgyz Republic remains cumbersome and not
transparent to the visitors.

What is the commitment? To develop a brief description of the procedure for
granting access to the building for the citizens with clear
requirements for each group of visitors and post these
documents on the website of the Parliament, as well as
launching an option on the website www.kenesh.kg to
accept online applications for attendance of the meetings
and entrance to the premises of the Jogorku Kenesh
to meet a certain MP and the opportunity to receive a
response to the mailbox or by SMS.

How will the commitment contribute to the resolution of the public problem?
Visitors of the Parliament premises will receive clear
instructions defining the procedures of entrance to the
building, and will be able to apply for attendance online,
which will enhance interaction of the citizens with the
Parliament and, as a result, improve the quality of the
parliamentary work.

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?
It leads to transparency and accountability of the
Jogorku Kenesh and broadens engagement of the
citizens in the work of the Parliament.

Commitment description

What is the public problem that the commitment will address?
The citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic do not yet perceive
the Jogorku Kenesh of the Kyrgyz Republic as the
supreme constitutional body performing legislative and
oversight functions. Citizens rather work individually with
each MP to resolve their personal issues. This is due to
a lack of understanding of the role of the Parliament and
insufficiency of the information.

What is the commitment? Currently, several TV and radio channels broadcast live
meetings of the JK KR. OTRK, ElTR and other channels
broadcast “Lessons of Parliamentarism” (information
program on the work of the Parliament and the results of
its work). The communication strategy of the Parliament
was adopted to develop the system of communication
with the population and to inform about its work in
accordance with the approved annual plans.
Within the framework of the “Open Parliament”
implementation plan, it is planned to launch a series of
programs on the functions and tasks of the Parliament
(once a month), as well as short clips about the Jogorku
Kenesh (promotion through TV, radio and social
networks).

How will the commitment contribute to the resolution of the public problem?
It will contribute to the increase of the awareness of the
population about the role of the Jogorku Kenesh of the
Kyrgyz Republic.

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?
Openness and accessibility of the MPs, informing the
population.

Commitment description

What is the public problem that the commitment will address?
According to the semi-annual report of the Open
Government National Forum and results of the evaluation
of the implementation of the Resolution № 360-r dated
October 16, 2018, only 20% of the measures / actions of
the National Action Plan were implemented. Despite the
fact that the Forum is co-chaired by the Vice Prime Minister
of the Kyrgyz Republic, the executive authorities do not
implement their obligations in time. In this regard, it is
necessary to strengthen oversight functions of Parliament
of the Kyrgyz Republic as a legislative body to which the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and other state bodies
are accountable.

What is the commitment? 
The Jogorku Kenesh undertakes to monitor and evaluate
the implementation of the National Open Government
Action Plan by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic
(Resolution No. 360-r dated October 16, 2018).

How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem?
The parliamentary monitoring and evaluation of the
implementation of the abovementioned Resolution No.
360-r dated October 16, 2018 by the state bodies will allow
to strengthen the control over the fulfillment of the assigned
obligations, accelerate the achievement of the expected
results of the NAP, attract public attention to the existing
problems to be solved in result of the implementation of
the NAP, and involve civil society in the process of public
monitoring.

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?
Transparency: Evaluation and monitoring by the Jogorku
Kenesh will facilitate the preparation of an alternative
report for the public.
Participation of citizens: Ensured participation of
citizens in the time of reporting by the state bodies
involved in the implementation of NAP obligations at the
sessions of the Jogorku Kenesh.

 WHAT ARE THE STATE AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST ISSUES WHICH HELPS MEETING THIS
 COMMITMENT?
 Civic participation is important for any country's development, because it is a mechanism for the wider community
 needs and interests for the collection and transfer of decision-makers. At the same time it strengthens the participatory
 culture by promoting constructive and targeted cooperation. Public participation opportunities for Latvian Constitutional
 down 65, 101 and
 Article 104. Cabinet of Ministers of 25 August 2009 No rules. 970 ""public participation procedures for the development
 planning process"" 15 down public participation procedure of the Saeima, the Cabinet of Ministers, public administration,
 planning regions and local development planning process. These Regulations stipulate the general public participation.
 Participation is possible, beginning with the initiation of the document (including the problem of Konsta Chopping and
 policy alternatives) to the introduction of monitoring and evaluation. The public can participate in working groups,
 advisory councils, public discussions, public consultation, in writing to give an opinion or opinion and other ways. At the
 initial stage, the authority has the task of planning for public participation, and opt for the ways that contribute to
 effective, open, inclusive, timely and responsible community involvement.
 Different formats discussing the Cabinet Regulations implementing the practical aspects, it is concluded that the regulatory
 framework everything is clearly defined and the content of the substantial amendments are not necessary, but the main problem is
 the low awareness of the importance of public participation and

 its benefits as well as the needs of society appropriate methods for public participation and public
 administration and local governments.
 What is missing is the monitoring mechanism referred to Cabinet enforcement control, especially in local
 governments. Public administration often community engagement measures are not sufficiently effective
 and transparent manner. Therefore, measures to be taken to promote awareness and education on the
 public participation processes available options and the benefits of public participation, promoting thinking
 and a change of behavior in public administration and local governments for public participation. It is also
 important to disseminate examples of good practice. According to non-governmental initiatives in 2005 it
 was signed the Non-Governmental Organizations and the Cabinet of Ministers of Understanding
 (hereinafter - the Memorandum). Since 2014, when it was renewed the Memorandum of content, its
 objective is to promote effective and adequate public interest in public administration,
 2017th year memorandum joined over
 400 NGOs, ie. see. several of them together and represent the interests of many NGOs. Implementation of the Memorandum
 provides a consultative body - the Memorandum of the Board, which is composed of the national government and NGOs set
 their own elected representatives. Memorandum Council has become an important platform where every month to discuss
 issues affecting the NGO sector in nature and, in general, as well as opportunities for participation. In general, the memorandum
 Board activities benefits are the following aspects - are updated horizontal NGO sector issues, are provided with opportunities to
 influence decision-making, there is communication and feedback between NGOs and public administration.
 One of the Memorandum of the Council's work plan tasks in 2017 was to develop guidelines Advisory Councils. The
 guidance aims to explain the principles of good practice outcomes advisory councils, aimed at more efficient use of
 public participation in the resources sector policy development and implementation. Once approved, the guidelines
 planned to send all line ministries, calling on the principles laid down to take account of the ministries and their
 subordinate institutions advisory councils in action. It is planned as a guideline to inform the activities of the
 participating interest.
 Memorandum Council's work plan also includes other tasks, such as planned for the activities of NGOs more widely to inform
 local authorities.
 Similar good practice example of public involvement in decision-making concerning it, is the Society Integration
 Fund (hereinafter - SIF) management mechanism. One of the tasks of the SIF is to support the public and
 non-governmental development programs and projects. Therefore, the SIF Board along with representatives of state
 institutions is six NGOs. Cooperation in decision-making also contributes to the non-governmental sector and other
 public figures. For example, currently we have with the association ""Public Participation Fund"" maintained by the
 portal ManaBalss.lv 16 help citizens to propose new legislative initiatives. ManaBalss.lv portal is planned to implement
 a new project ""ParVaiPret"", which the company

 representatives will have the opportunity to express their views, digitally voting on the most important draft laws and
 decisions to be discussed at the Saeima plenary session. Express their views on a proposed citizens' legislative initiative
 to be submitted by the Saeima it can by signing the Single state and municipal services portal www.latvija.lv, in one of the
 119 municipalities or at a notary public, but about these options, not all residents are aware 17th
 In general, not all sections of society, especially in the regions, sufficient information is available on a variety of opportunities for
 public participation in decision-making and engagement opportunities for state and local government institutions. Measures
 providing information on the importance of public participation and opportunities can be made, such as cooperation with the
 national uniform customer service centers.
 Pressing issue is how to essentially strengthen the advocacy capacity of the non-governmental sector and
 promote the development of NGOs carrying out public participation feature. For advocacy and social mobilization
 of NGOs do not have sufficient funds, so that the above-mentioned activities essential to attract public support.
 That reason was the basis for the state budget-funded ""NGO Fund"" establishment in 2015, the period within
 which to
 2018 annually allocated 400 000 EUR, which are available to NGOs in an open competition. The financing of the
 2019 will be decided in 2018.
 To promote public participation in Latvian can help other OECD countries highlighted in the OECD public
 participation good practice database 18 and the OECD guidelines for 'good practice principles for stakeholder
 involvement "" 19 which soon meant to confirm.
 WHAT IS COMMITMENT?

LT0032,Lithuania,5,3,LTU,Europe,National,1,2021,2023,2,NA,Assessing Impact of Draft Decisions and Making the Results Publicly Available,Assessing Impact of Draft Decisions and Making the Results Publicly Available,"Status quo and problem addressed by the commitment Article 15 of the Law on Legislative Framework provides that when drawing up a draft legal act which provides for regulation of previously unregulated relations, also whereby legal regulation is substantially amended, assessment of the effect of envisaged legal regulation must be carried out. The comprehensiveness of this assessment must be proportionate to the likely consequences of the envisaged legal regulation. According to Article 15(3) of the Law on Legislative Framework, the results of assessment of the effect of envisaged legal regulation provided for in a draft law or another draft legal act of the Seimas shall be presented in an explanatory note or a separate document, e.g. following the Regulatory impact assessment guidelines, the results of the impact assessment may be presented in a regulatory impact assessment certificate. Also, following Articles 21.2 and 38.1 of the Rules of Procedure of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania, the letter (submission) submitting a draft legislation for feedback or for Government’s consideration must specify the problem to be addressed through the legislative proposal, the substance of regulation proposed through legislative proposal: solution of the issue (solution measures), solution costs, benefits and/or expected outcomes. Information must be concise, the problem to be addressed must be substantiated by data, the costs, and benefits of the implementation of the proposed solution must be substantiated by quantitative and/or qualitative assessments. All draft legislation and accompanying documentation (submission, explanatory note, regulatory impact assessment certificate, etc.) must be published in the Legal Acts Information System (in Lithuanian: TAIS), which is free and accessible to all the people and stakeholders. Hence, impact assessment of legislative proposals is available to the public at large, including academic and business communities and all the stakeholders. However, such publication of results of the assessment of the potential regulatory impact is not always acceptable to the public, so there is a need to publicise certain Government decisions in a more publicly acceptable and comprehensible form. The Government can approve up to 1.400 different decisions per year, which greatly differ in terms of their scope and the diversity of matters to be regulated but also in terms of their significance (as legislation is improved and amended also in editorial and technical terms) and the extent of possible consequences. For example, only about 170 from 1.400 of annual average of Government-approved decisions are related to the approval of relevant draft packages. As we know, all the key provisions of state-regulated societal relations must be consolidated in law, hence, presumably it would be best to find ways to inform the public in simple and clear language about positive and/or negative consequences of key laws that are or will be deliberated by the Government. Every six months, the Government selects, from its legislative plan, draft legislation that can potentially have greater impact. Projects are selected on the basis of specific greater impact criteria agreed by the Government. The number of such projects ranges on average from 8 to 10 in six months. Given that greater impact legislation is selected, it is appropriate that during public consultations and/or adoption of such legislation the public is informed in greater detail and in a more comprehensible and accessible manner about the expected benefits and consequences. It would also be appropriate to store and publicise the results of impact assessments of the selected greater-impact legislation in one place making them accessible to the general public and academia, as well as to all the stakeholders. 

Problem solution/commitment Develop a mechanism for presenting the expected benefits and potential consequences of Government decisions that may have a considerable impact on society, in full or in part, or on certain specific target groups in a comprehensible and publicly acceptable manner. 

Main objective Provide clear and comprehensible public information about the expected benefits and costs of potentially greater-impact legislation under Government’s consideration, and underlying reasons for the specific decisions. 

How will the commitment contribute to the public problem? The mechanism for presenting the expected benefits and potential consequences of Government decisions that may have a considerable impact on society in a simple and publicly accessible and convenient manner will enable public access to and better understanding of Government decisions and their expected benefits and consequences after enactment. The introduction of standardised publicity of the benefits and consequences of the proposed regulation is expected to lead to a more cautious approach by law-drafting civil servants in their assessment and documentation of potential benefits and consequences for the general public or certain target groups.

Key challenge addressed 

Absence of systematic, coherent, evidence-based, and transparent legislative processes. Despite the adoption of all necessary regulatory measures, their practical implementation remains scarce. This context offers minimal opportunities for the engagement and participation of civil society and NGOs. Stakeholders are involved either belatedly or not at all in project preparation, often due to tight deadlines, limited communication channels, and unclear drafting stages. Furthermore, the means for citizen involvement and their tangible impact 21 on decision-making remain ambiguous. Engagement continues as insufficient, ineffective, and often superficial. 

The root causes for the problem 

The causes manifest themselves across various dimensions: 

Inconsistent legislative processes | As per the 2018 National Audit Office audit report, approximately 50% of draft legislation is rushed through or adopted with urgency.13 Although the proportion of such documents has nearly halved during the 2020-2024 parliamentary term (29.14% in 2016-2020 to compare with 15.96% in 2020-2024), stakeholders argue that the legislative process continues to operate in an ad hoc manner. Public consultations in the pre-legislative phases are rare, as solutions are often predetermined without comprehensive engagement.14 It is also important that other legislation, including regulatory orders of ministers and bodies subordinate to ministries, are not properly and consistently coordinated with the authorities concerned. Where the authorities concerned have not been identified, the draft order is not published on the Draft Legislation Information System of the Seimas (TAIS) and the public is not given the opportunity to react to it. In this scenario, documents are signed without public consultation, and legislative procedures fail to adhere to the principles of openness and transparency, neglecting to guarantee public input in the absence of alternative forms of consultation. In practice, the draft of any regulatory act (order) should ideally be published in the TAIS before adoption, allowing for consultations and feedback. 

The legislative initiative institute is practically unimplementable | The legislative initiative institute is seldom put to practice, even though the Law on Legislative Framework provides for it. It remains underutilized and often misunderstood by institutions, resulting in missed opportunities for obtaining pertinent legislative information and preparing for further meaningful public consultations. Stakeholder institutions, particularly in the non- governmental sector, struggle to anticipate when legislative initiatives will be enacted, hindering their ability to prepare and respond effectively. 

Lack of data utilisation in public sector decision-making | The public sector is still facing challenges related to the lack of open data sets, data quality, and lack of expertise among public sector personnel. Considering these factors, data-driven decisions may still rely on erroneous information and result in incorrect solutions. 

Action description 

Previous solution: In 2021, attempts were made to regulate and standardize ministerial legislative process by making the provisions of the Government’s Rules of Procedure apply mutatis mutandis to legislation, but there has been no support from the ministries. 

Planned solution/action: 

Regulatory changes to the ministerial legislative process | The aim is to ensure that the legislative standard, procedures, and deadlines set out in the Government’s Rules of Procedure are also applied at the level of ministries, government agencies and bodies subordinate to ministries in the drafting and collaborative consensus-building of legislation they adopt. Strengthened controls would ensure that drafts that lack proper consensus do not surface on a Government meeting agenda. 

Publication of the legislative plan | An upgrade of the TAIS is currently under preparation,. It will enable integrated monitoring of the entire drafting process from an initial idea to a final outcome. Until the TAIS is upgraded, the action will enable the publication and monitoring of the planned work of the Seimas session, and the drafting process of other key legislation (either on TAIS or on the My Government portal; the My Government portal operates on a different principle and it would not duplicate TAIS in essence, and the formats for presenting information on these two channels would also differ). 

Methodological guidance and education to ensure the practical implementation of a quality legislative process |The methodological guidance is a set of guidelines for public authorities and their staff who initiate and draft legislation. The methodological guidance would cover the whole legislative process: it would highlight the importance of each stage (including public consultation) for quality legislation and its sustainability, thereby structuring and synthesising the knowledge needed by drafters and other actors involved in the legislative process. The education campaign would focus on developing competences for data-driven and evidence-based decision-making. 

Stakeholder education | This action aims to facilitate meaningful involvement of stakeholders in legislative processes. It encompasses education initiatives, communication campaigns, and other activities designed to enhance awareness of the legislative process and opportunities for stakeholder engagement. A strong emphasis will be placed on equipping stakeholders with the skills to utilize available data for making well-informed recommendations for improved legislation. 

Intended outcomes 

The overarching goal is to ensure a systematic, cohesive, and transparent legislative process. Key deliverables: • Enhanced civic engagement in decision-making (measured by both the quantity and quality of legislative proposals). • Practical application of Methodological guidelines and exchange of best practices. • To measure the impact of this action, a monitoring indicator will be developed to show the proportion of correctly or incorrectly drafted legislation. It is also important to note that the actions will partially contribute to the intended outcomes for the development of the justice system under the 2022-2030 Development Programme run by the Ministry of Justice: • The proportion of laws subjected to ex-post evaluation out of the total number of laws adopted in 2020 and beyond (a deliverable for 2030: 3%) 

The role of the action in advancing openness 

How will the action contribute to increasing transparency, accountability, and public participation in decision- making? The Model for monitoring legislative process will enhance the transparency of legislative processes, enabling the public to follow the actual decision-making in progress. The data-driven legislative process will bolster the quality and clarity of decision-making. Education campaigns will empower civil society to engage meaningfully in legislative processes. The action will pave the way for more transparent communication of ongoing processes.

Commitment description
What is the public problem that the commitment will address?	Budgetary transparency and transparency of public procurement are high importance topics and are often discussed by the community –at-large.  Public procurement is a system where public needs meet private offers, and is a sphere with huge corruption risks. Good regulation and transparent procedures are necessary to minimize these risks, along with creating a market of tenders that makes government procurements effective and fosters competition at the same time. The citizen should be informed about use of public financial resources, understand the main budgetary documents and have access to data online. 
What is the commitment?	Commitment refers to improve budgetary transparency and transparency of public procurement. The commitment includes activities aiming at facilitating the understanding of the main budgetary documents, ensuring availability of data online, including via BOOST database and publication of reports about public procurement contracts monitoring.
How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem?	The implementation of the commitment will contribute to an increased level of understanding of budgetary process and the ways public money is spent.

ME0071,Montenegro,3,9,MNE,Europe,National,1,2022,2024,2,Open Data and Free Access to Information,Improve digital accessibility standards for people with disabilities,Improve Digital Accessibility Standards for People with Disabilities,"What public problem does the measure address? This measure responds to the problem of the still inconsistent application of standards of accessibility of materials from the websites of public institutions for persons with disabilities, and to the need to improve the existing platform for access to information, especially for visually impaired and deaf-mute people, as well as to improve the accessibility of information published on existing websites. The new Government portal, published in May 2021, represents the main communication channel of the Government and ministries and provides a new user and visual experience, which is reflected in the unified online appearance of ministries and state administration bodies. As stated in the Final Report on the Implementation of the National Action Plan for the Implementation of the OGP Initiative in Montenegro 2018-2020, the launch of the Government's new portal has for the first time ensured the full application of accessibility standards recommended by the Law on Electronic Administration, as well as the possibility of reading the content, and on based on consultations with organizations that represent the needs of PWDs. The portal meets the requirements of e-accessibility and a special menu has been implemented for improved content accessibility with control of contrast, font size, text spacing, animations, then a visual guide for easier reading, highlighting of links, compatibility with screen readers through the structure of the pages, as well as a special font that makes reading easier for people with dyslexia. On the basis of the Law on electronic administration, the Rulebook on accessibility standards was drawn up according to which state bodies, state administration bodies, state agencies, state funds and other holders of public authority (hereinafter referred to as: bodies) and local self-government bodies, local government bodies, special and public services, independent and regulatory bodies and legal and natural persons exercising public powers (hereinafter referred to as: other entities) that provide electronic administration services through a single information system, as well as through an information system that they establish themselves, must meet accessibility standards, and especially to persons with disabilities. A draft of the Instructions on the creation of electronically readable materials was prepared, but there was no training for employees, with the aim of training them for the creation of e-readable materials. On the other hand, the Digital Transformation Strategy 2022-2026 states that it is still necessary to work on increasing the number of accessible documents that are published on official websites. Also, the report of the Union of the Blind of Montenegro points to the still poor progress of public institutions in providing free access to information for visually impaired persons, contrary to the Law on Prohibition of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities. Regarding the accessibility of information about the work of the legislative branch of government, the internet presentation of the Parliament of Montenegro, which was redesigned in March 2021, was adapted for software used by blind and partially sighted people, which was done in cooperation with the Union of the Blind of Montenegro. The accessibility of the site is guided by the Guidelines for ensuring the accessibility of online content 1.0, of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and its functionality is based on cooperation with content authors, developers and associations of persons with disabilities, in order to meet AA standards. The next step, which would contribute to the additional improvement and simplification of access to parliamentary information, involves the provision of the ""Accessibility"" service with complete options as shortcuts for existing possibilities. 

What does this measure entail? The measure includes activities aimed at encouraging better application of digital accessibility standards for people with disabilities and especially facilitating access to information for visually impaired and deaf-mute people. 

In what way does the measure contribute to the solution of the identified public problem? It is expected that the new training cycle of officials on the effective application of digital accessibility standards for people with disabilities, as well as the introduction of a special platform for access to information for the visually impaired and deaf and mute, and the additional improvement of the accessibility of information published on the Internet presence of the Parliament of Montenegro, will further strengthen application of accessibility standards for persons with disabilities. 

Why is this measure relevant in relation to the values promoted through the OGP initiative? This measure is directly relevant to the values of transparency and openness of public administration, as well as the participation of citizens, especially vulnerable groups, in the creation of public policies. 

Additional information This measure is complementary to the goals and activities of the Digital Transformation Strategy of Montenegro 2022-2026, especially with the aim of e-inclusion where the use of digital platforms of public institutions by persons with disabilities is to be further improved. The trainings for civil servants planned by this NAP are complementary to the activities of the Action Plan of the Digital Transformation Strategy of Montenegro, which aim to improve digital knowledge and skills for sensitive groups of citizens (elderly population, people with disabilities, RE population, etc.) in the process of lifelong learning. By implementing this measure, a contribution is made to the realization of the goals of sustainable development, especially goal 10 (Reduce inequality between and within countries) and the related task 10.2 (Strengthen and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of everyone, regardless of age, gender, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status), as well as goal 16. (Peace, justice and strong institutions) and especially tasks 16.7. - ensuring responsible, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making and 16.10. -Ensure public access to information and protection of basic freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements.

 Implementation of the constitutional and legislative provisions in
terms of participatory and citizen-based democracy.
 Implementation by the House of Representatives of the
constitutional reforms in order to modernize its action and ensure a
better openness and communication with the citizens.
 The House of Representatives has devoted two chapters of its
bylaws to the pinpointing of the procedures of the practical
implementation of these rights.

What does the commitment consist of?
The commitment amounts to the implementation of a system of petitions and
motions within the House of Representatives.
A committee in charge of the reception and the management of the legislative
petitions and motions of citizens, is set up at the level of the bureau of the
House of Representatives. Within its annual action plan, it intends to
organize meetings/debates at the central and territorial levels with NGOs,
which do supervise the initiatives conducted by the citizens in the fields of
legislative petitions and motions, define the common frameworks of action
and elaborate the awareness raising tools (a practical guide) of the stake of
their actions and the procedures to follow.
What comes at stake at this stage, as well, is the development of the IT
platform for the management of the motions and the petitions. Such an
infrastructure is supposed to guarantee more transparency and fluidity.

How shall the commitment contribute to solving the public problem?
The House of Representatives, by virtue of its stand as a depository of the
legislative authority has fully assumed its role concerning the
implementation of the political and legal framework for the
implementation of such provisions : Two organic laws , which are
respectively related to the terms of the exercise of the right to present
petitions before the public authorities, as well as the conditions of the 
exercise of the right to put forward legislative petitions, have entered into
force since 2016.

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?
Such a new form of democratic exercise which allows citizens, among
others, to present to the public authorities, and to the elected institutions,
legislative petitions and motions, is, doubtlessly, a precondition for the
consolidation and the strengthening of the representative democracy.
It should ensure the accession of the citizens and their implication in

This is about strengthening access to information detained by the public
administration, by the elected institutions as well as the organizations with
public service missions, given that this is a fundamental human right which
is guaranteed by the Moroccan Constitution. Right now, there aren’t any
regulatory provisions as per defining which information are to be
published.
The House of Representatives publishes the following information on the
web site:
http://www.chambredesrepresentants.ma/fr/annuaire-parlementaire.
It is worth noting that the majority of these data are not complete.
Consequently, the civil society organizations do encounter some difficulties
when it comes to finding out such information.

What does the commitment consist of?
Voluntarist dissemination and publication of information, data and
documents produced by the House of representatives, namely debates
which take place in plenary sessions as well throughout the committees’
meetings, the reports of the parliamentary fact finding committees, the
reports of the information missions, the reports of the thematic groups and
the reports of the public policy evaluation.
Given that by virtue of the law, a national committee is set up to the head of
Government’s office, and taking into consideration the separation of
powers’ principle, a committee in charge of the implementation of the
constitutional and legislative provisions regarding the right to access
information, shall be set up to report to the Speaker of the House of
Representatives.
In a similar vein, it makes a triumphant statement about opening the archive
of the House of Representatives to the public use, and to place the digital
documents on line (more than a million six hundred thousand documents
in open data) ; documents related to the determining moments of the
national political and parliamentary life, have been published in the past,
but aren’t any more accessible nowadays since the House of Representatives
is the unique custodian of the document library.

How shall the commitment contribute to solving the public problem?
This pertains to opening, to the public, many important chapters of the
political history of the country.

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?
Respecting and making this universal right respected, should guarantee
equality to all in terms of having access to information. It is considered as
an indispensable condition for transparency and good governance.

Citizens do not trust public institutions, including the parliament. They do
have the feeling that the laws as they are voted today by the parliament do
not express the real general will of the people. Citizens do have the
impression that their representatives do not care about what they think, and
that they do not represent them properly. Besides, the amalgam created by
the social media and the media in general contribute to the youth’s
displeasure and poor opinion about the parliament and the elected officials.
Implementation of an ambitious and broadly rich communication plan which
targets the youth in particular, via a physical openness approach while
upholding relevant and appropriate content and discourse as disseminated
by various means of communication.
Integrating with success the increasing number of youth in the democratic
process that Morocco has embarked on poses many challenges, but equally
represents great opportunities.
Up to date, however, many young people find out themselves on the
margins of the political process, as they are very often called upon to
reclaim social and political change.
In order to become truly inclusive and representative, parliaments should
spare no effort in order to open their institution, so that the ideas and needs
of the youth be harnessed in a democratic manner.
 Increase the number of visitors of the House of Representatives, by
reinforcing the staff capacity in the organization and facilitated access
of visitors, through setting up units of public relations in order to
oversee and facilitate the access of the public to the headquarters of the
parliament.
 Increase substantially the number of groups’ facilitated visits, namely
groups of pupils from both the primary, junior and high schools as well 
as students from colleges and universities beyond the close
neighborhood of the capital Rabat.
 Create a space for the historical memory of the parliament of Morocco,
which reminds the young generations of the parliamentary group as
imbricated in its national context.
 Diversify the dissemination of contents that are meant to bring the
public closer to the parliament’s life, parliament’s debates, new
legislation, parliament’s initiatives, through the publications, the
Parliament’s channel, as well as the social media of the House of
Representatives.
 Elaborate communication toolkits (the booklets) designed for the
children and for the youth and organize meetings/debates at the
regional level (within the framework of the mobile parliament).

The Consultation and the engagement of citizens in the processes of public
policies ‘evaluation
What does the
commitment consist of ?
-Spur parliamentary groups and members of the parliament to propose topics
of programmes and public policies‘ evaluations, the latter target a population
which can be identified, and, therefore, consulted with by the taskforce in
charge of conducting the evaluation, both upstream as well as downstream, in
accordance with the referential framework set up for the evaluation of public policies.
- Spur the steering committee of the taskforce in charge of conducting the
evaluation decided by the bureau of the House of Representatives to opt for
evaluation criteria while taking into consideration the degree of impact of the
public policies on citizens’ lives.
These two criteria, which require field research, are up to making every
evaluation initiative an opportunity to communicate and allow for the
participation of a maximum number of beneficiaries and of the counterfactual
population of the programme, which is, indeed, the subject of the evaluation.
Such an association can be inscribed within the phase of the evaluation
preparation and that of the formulation of the conclusions together with the
recommendations.
-Invite the group in charge of the evaluation to ensure a good communication
with the ultimate target groups and beneficiaries in order to better define both
their needs and aspirations.
A synthesis of this communication shall be attached to the evaluation report.

To guarantee a better profitability of the evaluation project, a large
dissemination of the evaluation reports is a must. The follow up by the
political authorities of the House of Representatives is fundamental for the
improvement and the productivity of the public policies.
In terms of accountability, the conclusions of the evaluation reports can serve
as a basis for the evaluation of public interventions and their impact on the
population.
How shall the
commitment contribute
to solving the public
problem?
The House of Representatives has put into place a referential framework for
the evaluation of public policies, which acts as a guiding tool when it comes
to the management of the evaluation activities. While indicating the
procedure to follow throughout the whole process, from the very selection of
the topic to the elaboration of the final report. This guide, as well as, the bylaws of the House of Representatives, do give a prominent position to the
research techniques that spur the contribution of the stakeholders of the policy
or of the programme, which is subject to evaluation, namely the public
authorities all along with the entities in charge of the implementation of the
concerned public policies, and most particularly, the ultimate target groups
and beneficiaries.
Why is this commitment
relevant to OGP values?
The evaluation of the public policies is one of the new prerogatives of the
parliament of Morocco, which has been upgraded and fostered to the position
of parliamentary function, as stipulated by the new 2011 Constitution. The
House of Representatives has, from the very beginning, set its sight on the
serious and certain launch of this new function. First of all, through avoiding
the conceptual confusions with the related streams of work of the Parliament,
and secondly through ensuring its institutionalization which clearly
distinguishes the political from the scientific, in its practical exercise and in
terms of the credibility of these end products.",9/1/2019,12/31/2020,House of Representatives,"-The civil society organizations who are active in the field or sector

MO0047,Morocco,2,23,MAR,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2021,2023,2,Open Parliament,Consolidated partnership with societal actors to entrench the democratic culture,Parliamentary Consultation with Societal Actors,"What is the public issue in response to which the commitment was made? • The need for a strong-based and entrenched establishment of consultation with societal actors and their involvement in legislation, control, and evaluation • The need expressed by these societal actors regarding training in the area of submission of petitions and motions on legislation. 

What are the components of the commitment? The commitment consists of: • Involving the societal actors as the prime target in the process of implementing the OGP principles regarding Open Parliament; • Responding to the aspirations of societal actors expressed during the hearing sessions organized by the House of Representatives and the regional thematic seminars organized by our partners from the NDI; • Lifting this partnership with societal actors to the level of major commitment. Besides, this commitment builds on the gains and actions undertaken as part of the 2019-2020 Action Plan of the House of Representatives, and aims to: • Reinforce the capacities of societal actors in the principles, values, and fundamentals of the Open Government Partnership Initiative (OGP); • Mold trainers amongst societal actors to ensure the mentoring of local societal actors, mainly in terms of participatory and citizen democracy; • Incite and encourage civil society actors, academia, and research centers to utilize the documents and data produced by the House of Representatives in order to promote scientific research on parliamentary matters; • Accompany societal actors in embodying the roles and functions of the House of Representatives (control and scrutiny, legislation, public policy evaluation, and parliamentary diplomacy); • To achieve this goal, there must be an investment in the abilities of civil society by organizing thematic regional and local workshops and achieving a high level of orientation and training using quality content for civil society actors. 

How will this commitment contribute to solving this public issue? The House of Representatives, as a holder of legislative power, will fully engage in the process of reinforcing confidence, dialogue, and partnership with civil society, and hence with society in general, in terms of participatory democracy. The abilities and capacities of civil society and its leadership will be reinforced, which would enable the amelioration of its productivity in the exercise of the rights guaranteed to it by the Constitution. 

How is this commitment relevant to the OGP values? This form of democratic exercise, which enables citizens to address petitions to the competent institutions (executive and legislative branches) and motions on legislation, is surely a prerequisite for consolidating and reinforcing participatory democracy. It also aims to: • Ensure the adherence and involvement of citizens in the legislative process; • Promote the openness of the House of Representatives to society; • Encourage citizens to participate in the process of controlling government action and public policy evaluation; • Guarantee access and use of the documentary record of the legislative Institution; • Entrench and disseminate the culture of participatory democracy; • Value and utilize the open data the House of Representatives made available to academia and societal actors; This would enable the realization of the aspired accumulation in the academic research related to parliamentary affairs and democratic questions. 

Additional information • The House of Representatives launched a series of consolidated actions aiming at the amelioration of access to information and public participation. It also regularly ensures the respect of this right. The actions are: • Ensuring the implementation of Law 31-13 on the right to access information. • Creating a Committee linked to the Board of the House of Representatives in Charge of receiving petitions and motions on legislation. • The House also created an administrative unit in charge of receiving and responding to the requests for information by citizens. • The House of Representatives launched a process of developing an autonomous online platform to manage petitions and motions on legislation addressed to it. It should be noted that the platform “e-participation” has shown that comanagement by the Parliament and Government poses some hardships in form. • The House of Representatives concluded in January 2020 a partnership and scientific cooperation agreement with the Ministry of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education, Scientific Research, the Ministry Delegate in Charge of Higher Education and Scientific Research, and the 12 public Moroccan universities in order to promote scientific research and studies on parliamentary action. • The House created a prize for the best doctoral thesis and academic paper on democracy and parliamentary action. The prize in its second edition was awarded in July 2022. • The first forum with societal actors on general themes of Open Government and participatory democracy, which took place on May 23, 2019, and the second seminar on « Participatory democracy: Reality constraints and development perspectives » with the participation of societal actors and academia, which took place on February 25, 2020, culminated, partly, in ideas that were taken into consideration in the amendments adopted by the Parliament. (Organic Law 64.14 defining the conditions and modalities of the exercise of the right to present motions on legislation, as amended and supplemented by Organic Law 71.21; and Organic Law 44.14 defining the conditions and modalities of the exercise of the right to present petitions to public authorities, as amended and supplemented by Organic Law 70.21).

The process of material and spatial openness of the House of Representatives to society does not equally benefit all the regions of the Kingdom, hence impacting the degree of knowledge about the Parliament, which remains below the magnitude of the institution on the national political and institutional stage. 

What are the components of this commitment? The commitment consists of: • Organization of diverse activities at the territorial level with the participation of members from the House of Representatives, local actors, schools and universities, and societal actors (seminars, round tables, campaigns, and fora), which will only cover universities in the first phase. These activities will feature the presentation of several media that introduce the prerogatives of the House and the procedures of legislation, control, and evaluation (animated videos, graphic books, paper media “multilingual leaflets” and practical guides addressed to youth and schooled children). This activity was launched during the 2022 International Book and Publishing Fair. • Organization of workshops and hosting of presentations in order to enhance the degree of knowledge on the Parliament, its competencies, and roles of the public of different ages, especially youth and children, in order to provide them with a civic education based on a culture of participation and openness. 

How will this commitment contribute to solving this public issue? - The activities of proximity favor the adherence and involvement of citizens in the process of entrenching the Rule of Law. An institution that listens to citizens can only be respected. 

How is this commitment relevant to the OGP values? The adherence and involvement of citizens in the process of legislation, control, public policy evaluation would promote the principles of proximity, openness, and transparency. 

Additional information • The territorial openness actions in this regard on the regional and local levels were postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. • The House of Representatives put at the disposal of the public educational videos related to legislation, control, and public policy evaluation, information on the procedures of submitting petitions and motions on legislation, in addition to videos on the institutional actors and parliamentary diplomacy.

The material openness of the House of Representatives is an important tool for informing citizens about the roles and responsibilities of the legislative Institution, in addition to its architectural and cultural heritage in situ. However, the statistics show that 80% of visitors come from the areas surrounding the administrative capital of the Kingdom, which raises the question on equality of opportunities and equity in benefit from this measure. 

What are the components of this commitment? • Opening of the premises, buildings, and archives of the House of Representatives to the public. • Substantial increase in the number of guided and supervised group visits, particularly schoolchildren, pupils and students from higher schools and universities, including those from regions far from the capital; • Encouragement of citizen participation of young people to counter anti-parliamentarianism (a global phenomenon) and to strengthen trust in the Parliament; • Organization of open days at the seat of the House of Representatives; • Involvement of young people through awarenessraising, reopening of the ""Parliamentary Museum"" of the Moroccan Parliament, and organization of meetings with young people; • Provision to the ‘visiting public’ of various content that can enlighten them as to the parliamentary life; • Dissemination of pre-published and ready-to-use printed communication materials (booklets and leaflets) for children and young people; • Organization of meetings/debates with Representatives at the seat of the House of Representatives. 

How will this commitment contribute to solving the public issue? The increase in the number of visits can: - Encourage citizen participation and the spirit of commitment among future generations; - Curb the phenomenon of anti-parliamentarianism by strengthening the access of young citizens to information; - Strengthen the openness of the House of Representatives to society; - Promote the principle of spatial justice for visitors from remote regions. 

How is this commitment relevant to the OGP values? The commitment aims to enhance openness to the public through visits of citizens, who wish to access the premises of the House of Representatives and attend plenary sittings. It is also contributing to enhancing the transparency of the Parliament, by making documents and archives available for visitors, and enabling them to communicate with the Representatives. 

Additional information • The large party (98%) of the archives of the House of Representatives, consisting of documentation concerning all legislative terms starting from 1956, has been digitized and made available on the Intranet of the House. There are more than four millionpages of digitized archives that cover plenary sittings debates, reports of Standing Committees, legal texts, oral and written questions, and other documents relating to parliamentary action. These materials can be consulted and used by the personnel, the Representatives, and the Parliamentary Groups’ staff. • Researchers and the general public can also consult and use this documentation upon a request submitted to the Unit of Archives.

Consultation and involvement of citizens in the prerogatives and missions of the House of Representatives. 

What are the components of this commitment? This commitment, which intends to promote the inclusive participation of citizens, and to strengthen the processes of parliamentary work and the openness and transparency of the House of Representatives, is based on three axes: - With the aim of consolidating the accumulation achieved by the House in public policy evaluation, the House of Representatives will organize hearing, consultation, and dialogue sessions with target groups and final recipients of the public policy under evaluation, with a view to measuring the impact and effectiveness of public authorities’ intervention; - Creation of a space dedicated to citizen control of government action; thereby allowing citizens to propose control actions related to issues which are of importance to them; - Publication of government and parliamentary bills subjected to the legislative procedure in order to collect the comments and opinions of citizens thereon. This mechanism will enable the involvement of society further in the legislative process, the control of government action, and evaluation of public policies. 

How will this commitment contribute to solving the public issue? Citizen involvement in the legislative process fosters the inclusive adherence of citizens further and strengthens their trust in parliamentary action. The commitment also enables the measuring of the impact of this action on society. 

How is this commitment relevant to the OGP values? The Commitment promotes citizen participation and awareness of the challenges of institutional and participatory democracy; while strengthening citizen control over public policies in relation to the Parliament’s prerogatives. 

Additional information The House’s website publishes all government and parliamentary bills, thereby giving every citizen or organization the opportunity to express opinions and comment on legislative initiatives. For this purpose, the House of Representatives worked on setting up an internal unit to collect these opinions and comments and subsequently submit them to the competent bodies of the House. It is worth noting that the dialogue with societal actors (CSOs) has culminated recently in a set of ideas in the form of amendments, adopted by the House of Representatives, Organization Act No. 64.14, which establishes the conditions and procedures for the exercise of the right to submit (Organic Law No. 64.14, defining the conditions and procedures for the exercise of the right to submit motions on legislation, as amended and supplemented by Organic Law No. 71.21; Organic Law No. 44.14, defining the conditions and procedures for the exercise of the right to submit petitions to public authorities, as amended and supplemented by Organic Law No. 70.21.) The findings of evaluation reports serve as a basis for monitoring public interventions and their impact. A space dedicated to citizen control of government action will be created in order to enable citizens to propose control measures relating to issues of their interest.

The growing global phenomenon of citizens disengagement from politics, especially among young people, added to anti-parliamentarianism pose a danger to the future of institutional democracy in the world. The use of social networks as sources of information has sped up the spread of misinformation and ‘fake news,’ which undermines institutional democracy. Young people, who represent the living force of society, are the social category most liable to manipulation; therefore the tendency towards disengagement and neglect of representative institutions, political action and partisan participation is stronger among individuals of this age range. 

What are the components of this commitment? This commitment consists of organizing thematic summer camps to disseminate democratic values among young people. The summer camps serve as educational spaces for social upbringing and teaching of democratic values. Summer camps enable young people to embody the prerogatives, missions, and functions of Parliament (control, legislation, evaluation of public policies, and parliamentary diplomacy), and hence democratic values. 

How will this commitment contribute to solving the public issue? Understanding by young people of the roles and prerogatives of the Parliament strengthens civic sentiment, thus reversing the trend of antiparliamentarianism. Besides, the challenge is to convince young people, using teaching methods that rely on knowledge transfer in fun manners, of the imperative of institutional democracy and parliamentary action. These methods and tools will also enable young people to acquire reliable knowledge in order to ward off the misinformation that targets institutions. 

How is this commitment relevant to the OGP values? This new form of learning democratic values and dialogue will pave the way to strengthening the openness of the House of Representatives to young citizens. It will also strengthen the partnership relations between the House and NGOs that orient young people and summer camps, by establishing an institutionalized channel through which young people can express their own concerns; while putting forward proposals and ideas that can be embedded into parliamentary action. 

Additional information The use of summer camps as educational spaces for teaching democratic values and dialogue to young citizens is a good practice applied by a number of countries that have a long-standing history in democracy.

Representative institutions have become the target of anti-parliamentarian rhetoric. As a result, a portion of society considers the performance of these institutions to be below expectations. 

What are the components of this commitment? The commitment consists of initiating local, interactive fora on legal drafting by Representatives at the level of their constituencies, which would facilitate the learning and involvement of citizens in the process of drawing up preliminary drafts of legislative initiatives. 

How will this commitment contribute to solving the public issue? The implementation of this commitment serves to: - Enable citizens through these fora to be involved and familiarized with the process of legislation drafting; - Bring the House of Representatives closer to citizens; - Debunk misrepresentations of parliamentary action, particularly the ones related to legal drafting. 

How is this commitment relevant to the OGP values? This mechanism of proximity, listening, dialogue, and learning the techniques and tools of legal drafting will enable the reinforcement of the openness of the House of Representatives to citizens. It will also make the voice of citizens heard and involve them in the legislative process. Therefore, the interactivity between the House, via the Representatives, will be strengthened by giving citizens the opportunity to express themselves and put forward their opinions and suggestions to ameliorate legal texts that impact their lives. The “Local proximity fora on legal drafting” will also enable Representatives to mobilize electors around legislative initiatives. 

Additional information The ‘Local proximity fora on legal drafting’ will represent a space where citizens can express themselves and enrich legislative action through amendments or citizen bills in a direct way.

A report by the research and documentation centre of the Ministry of Security and Justice concluded that the Dutch government is very transparent. However, it is difficult for citizens and interest groups that do not encounter legislation every day to fathom what exactly happens in the process, and thus to have any influence over it.
Netwerk Democratie believes that the Netherlands must also create scope for this kind of interaction and hopes that volgdewet.nl will prompt a trend towards more interactive legislative procedures starting at the grassroots. This initiative therefore differs from the legislative calendar since Volg de Wet will include background information and explanations of various pieces of legislation under development.

NL0058,Netherlands,5,7,NLD,Europe,National,1,2023,2027,4,Equal information position of citizens,Open Parliament,Familiarizing Citizens with the Parliament,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

An open government starts with the foundation: citizens who are familiar with the rules of democracy and the rule of law, and who know what they can do to exert influence - at the municipal, regional, provincial, national, and European Union levels.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? • Research from the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (Sociaal Cultureel Planbureau or SCP) shows that compared to the past fifteen years, Dutch citizens have a more negative perception of the state of the country and politics. The dissatisfaction with the direction of the country is closely related to the dissatisfaction with politics: nearly half of those who believe things are going in the wrong direction attribute it to politics. In the fall of 2022, 43% had confidence in the House of Representatives (down from 52%) and 41% had confidence in the government (down from 50%). • Our democracy and rule of law require constant maintenance. The Dutch democratic rule of law has a long history and continues to evolve. While our democratic rule of law is robust, there are ongoing discussions about its functioning, as research indicates a decline in trust in democracy and the rule of law, with significant differences among different groups in society. This underscores the importance of active citizenship, which cannot be taken for granted. • The democratic rule of law cannot exist without active citizens. The democratic rule of law depends on citizens who are aware of their democratic rights and exercise them. Active citizenship can manifest in various ways, from voting to becoming politically engaged. Active and well-informed citizens can contribute to government policies that represent the interests of the residents and enhance support for measures. 

2. What are the causes of the problem? • Active democratic citizenship is not innate; it needs to be developed and requires basic knowledge. Political socialization largely takes place during adolescence, and education plays a crucial role in this process. • Education informs young people about democracy and the rule of law and emphasizes their invaluable role in a free and peaceful society. By doing so, education contributes to the learning and development of democratic awareness.

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? • Education center ProDemos has a unique role in making democracy and the rule of law accessible to a wide audience. Their mission is to inform and engage as many people as possible in the Netherlands about democracy. • ProDemos has three core objectives: - Informing: ProDemos provides knowledge about democracy and the rule of law and imparts the skills necessary to participate in them. - Activating: ProDemos encourages people to exercise their right to vote. - Promoting participation: ProDemos fosters participation so that people can make use of the opportunities to exert influence. • ProDemos organizes activities that enhance people’s knowledge and skills to participate in democracy. This strengthens political self-confidence, an essential requirement for active citizenship. Through their offerings, ProDemos contributes to increasing individuals’ understanding and engagement in the democratic process, resulting in stronger and more active citizenship. • The core activities of ProDemos currently include: - Visitors Centre: ProDemos’ Visitors Centre, located next to the Binnenhof in The Hague (Dutch Parliament), offers tours, educational programs, and other activities. Each year, they welcome tens of thousands of students, the general public, members of political organizations, and other interested individuals. Through these experiences, visitors gain insight into how politics, democracy, and the rule of law function. - Education: ProDemos collaborates with municipalities, provinces, courts, and educational institutions throughout the country. Through their educational programs, facilitators, and teaching materials, they provide clear explanations on various topics, such as becoming a city council member, the responsibilities of provinces, and the process of a court case. 

2. What solution are you proposing? A. Educating Youth: ProDemos enables young people to become acquainted with the levels of governance and institutions of democracy and the rule of law in the Netherlands during their school years. - Through their teaching materials, in-person and online guest lectures, and the expansion of their programs nationwide, they aim to align better with the curriculum and provide a range of opportunities to integrate democracy and the rule of law into the curriculum. This is particularly important in vocational education (MBO). - Additionally, ProDemos recognizes that The Hague is sometimes perceived as too distant for young people from outside the city, making it more challenging to reach them. Therefore, in the coming years, ProDemos will invest in increasing its reach by offering comprehensive activities throughout the country. B. Knowledge Center: In the coming years, ProDemos aims to reach a broader adult audience by providing access to knowledge and information on how they can exert influence and eventually develop an expanded educational offering. ProDemos aims to be a reliable source of information for them. C. Promoting Active Citizenship: Promoting citizen participation remains a significant ambition of ProDemos. Voting in elections is one of the most essential ways in which people can participate in the political process. Therefore, ProDemos undertakes various activities to enable people to make informed choices when elections take place. D.Parliamentary Visitors Center with a Future: ProDemos, together with the Municipality of The Hague and the Central Government Real Estate Agency (Rijksvastgoedbedrijf), is committed to keeping the city center vibrant during the renovation of the Binnenhof (Dutch Parliament). Their goal is to ensure that as many people as possible continue to visit political The Hague during the renovation, and they adapt their offerings accordingly. In collaboration with various partners in their network, they brainstorm about the future of the Visitors Center in preparation for the reopening of the Binnenhof after the renovation.

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? A. During primary school, students are introduced to democracy, both in the classroom and through visits to places like the municipal hall. In secondary education, students ideally visit the parliament. - In the programs for secondary education in The Hague, ProDemos aims to achieve a more balanced representation of students from vocational schools (vmbo), which is currently relatively small. Additionally, in the coming years, they want to expand their outreach through primary schools and vocational education (MBO), so that a broader audience can acquire knowledge about democracy and its functioning. B. In the coming years, ProDemos aims to reach a broader audience of adults and make politics and democracy more accessible for everyone. An important principle in this regard is to ensure that activities are as accessible as possible. This may involve adapting the language used or making the content more relevant and engaging for a wider target audience. C. During election periods, people actively seek information about the elections, presenting ProDemos with an excellent opportunity to inform and engage with harder-to-reach individuals. However, promoting active citizenship remains an important focus even outside election periods. Through various tools and activities, ProDemos explains how people can exert influence, whether it involves participating in demonstrations, having a say in municipal councils, or becoming politically active themselves. D. ProDemos intends to explore whether the “Grafelijke Zalen” (historic halls at the Binnenhof), after renovation, can be used more broadly and given a societal purpose. This could involve transforming them into a new Parliamentary Visitors’ Centre or opening them up to the public through events and open days. - Currently, these halls serve as a reception centre for the government and the High Councils of State, with limited availability for conferences, receptions, and other events. ProDemos wants to investigate whether these historic halls can serve a broader societal function, providing an accessible space for visitors to learn more about parliamentary democracy and bringing citizens and politics closer together.

Commitment Analysis 

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? ProDemos aims to make the functioning of our parliamentary democracy more transparent by providing physical access to the parliamentary buildings for young people and adults in the Netherlands, and by educating them about democratic processes, participation, and the rule of law. 

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? Indirectly, by increasing the knowledge level of a broad audience regarding democratic processes, institutions, and the rule of law, people become more aware of their rights and are better able to critically follow government actions. 

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? ProDemos explains the rules of democracy and the rule of law and demonstrates what individuals can do to exert influence at the municipal, water board, provincial, national, and European levels. Through these efforts, ProDemos promotes active citizenship and empowers individuals to participate more effectively.

Objective: To improve access to legislation by publishing all subordinate instruments (regardless of who drafts them) on the New Zealand Legislation (NZL) website. The result will be a single, comprehensive, official, public source of all New Zealand’s legislation. Status quo: There is no single place where people can see all of New Zealand’s legislation. All Acts of Parliament are published in full on the NZL website. Subordinate instruments (often referred to as regulations) are made under the delegated law-making authority of Parliament. Those that are drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) are called legislative instruments and are also published in full on the NZL website. Those that are drafted by government departments and agencies, and by other non-governmental bodies, are published either in the Gazette or on a variety of different websites, in newspapers or are not readily available to the public.

Objective:
To improve public understanding of how Parliament works and engage a
greater number of people with its work.
Ambition:
People will be able to access information about how Parliament works more
easily and more people will engage with Parliament and have their say.
Parliament aims to reach a larger and more diverse audience across all
its digital and broadcasting channels – Parliament website, Parliament TV,
Facebook pages, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram - by June 2020. It also aims
to grow engagement, measured by more actions taken across all channels, by
June 2020. Currently (October 2018) Parliament has:
• Facebook: 10,137 followers (NZ Parliament and Select Committee
pages)
• Twitter: 17,174 followers
• LinkedIn: 3,737 followers
• Instagram: 403 followers.
While the audience numbers across channels vary substantially and are still
low for many, the aim is to enhance the use of these (and establish new
channels if required), to lead to increased engagement with Parliament.
Status quo:
A Colmar Brunton report, Exploring New Zealanders’ understanding of, and
engagement with, Parliament and the democratic process, commissioned by
Radio New Zealand and the Office of the Clerk in October 2017 suggested:
• Only a minority of the population inform themselves about the
issues and processes of Parliament, and most are detached from
parliamentary process and only a minority of the population inform
themselves about the issues and outcomes.
• People do not necessarily understand how Parliament or democracy
affects their lives and do not actively seek information on the
parliamentary process and how to engage because it’s not for
‘everyday Kiwis’.
• Parliament is compared to the sun, ‘we know it is there and it is
important but it is too far.’ Lead Agency: Office of the Clerk of the House

readily accessible",Making New Zealand’S Secondary Legislation Readily Accessible,"Commitment 4: Making New Zealand’s secondary legislation
readily accessible
Objective:
To make New Zealand’s secondary legislation readily-accessible4
.
Ambition:
This commitment will continue the work that was started in the National
Action Plan 2016-2018. Parliamentary Counsel Office will work with the
makers of secondary legislation to gather information about their secondary
legislation and make it available on the New Zealand Legislation website
(http://www.legislation.govt.nz/).
As a first step New Zealanders will be able to access a complete list (and
related information) of current secondary legislation, including where the
full text can be found.
Status quo:
Currently, makers of secondary legislation are empowered to make that
legislation then publish it in a variety of ways, or not publish it at all. To
date, Parliamentary Counsel Office has identified over 100 different makers
of secondary legislation and the majority of them are not part of central
Government agencies. The result is that it is difficult for people to find
secondary legislation and to know whether they have the current version if
they do find it.
Approach:
Parliamentary Counsel Office is undertaking a project to make secondary
legislation available on the New Zealand legislation website (alongside
Acts, Bills, and other legislation). The part of the project covered by this
commitment is expected to be an intermediate stage that will provide a
complete list (and related information) of current secondary legislation on
the New Zealand Legislation website, including where the full text can be
found. The second and later stage involves the publication of the full text of
secondary legislation to the New Zealand Legislation website.
Legislation is required to provide the framework and create obligations on
makers of secondary legislation to support this work. The Legislation Bill
is currently before the House and a companion Bill with the working title
of Secondary Legislation (Access) Bill will also be introduced to Parliament. Regulations will be needed, amongst other things, to specify the list
information that makers will need to provide.
This work will greatly improve access to and transparency of New Zealand’s
secondary legislation. Secondary legislation published on the website will be
subject to oversight by Parliament’s Regulations Review Committee, which
will ensure proper process for all secondary legislation.

NG0015,Nigeria,2,1,NGA,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2019,2022,3,Fiscal Transparency,"To ensure more effective citizens’ participation across the entire budget cycle, including audit process.",Participatory Budgeting,"Brief description of commitment:  
This commitment will ensure that citizens participate and make inputs into the budget process, starting with the pre-budget statement (Call Circular, MTEF, MTSS, etc.), executive budget proposal, budget debate through public hearings in the legislature, implementation, monitoring, reporting and auditing of the budget. It will also guarantee that budget information is made accessible to all.

Problem of challenge addressed:
There is inadequate citizens’ engagement and participation in the budget preparation, approval, implementation monitoring and audit process. This results in citizens not having information, and thus not being able to relate to the projects in the budget. This ultimately weakens accountability in resource allocations.

Specific OGP Issue:
i.        Low citizens’ participation in the budget cycle.
ii.        Ineffective management of public resources.
iii.        Poor public services ratings.
iv.        Low budget performance.
v.        Weak transparency mechanism.

Rationale for the Commitment: 
By making budget information available and accessible to all citizens promptly and in a usable format, this commitment will improve accountability on the part of Government, provide openness and transparency in the budget process, and ensure that citizens are engaged throughout the budget cycle.

Main objective:
To ensure that budget planning, approval, implementation, monitoring, reporting, auditing meet the needs of citizens and that citizens have open access to budget information in a format that is both human and machine-readable.

Anticipated impact: 
Improved transparent and accountable citizens-oriented governance, through effective budget implementation and participation.

MK0199,North Macedonia,6,16,MKD,Europe,National,1,2024,2026,2,OPEN PARLIAMENT,REGISTRY OF THE REGULATORY BODIES ESTABLISHED BY THE ASSEMBLY,Registry of Regulatory Bodies Established by The Assembly,"Brief description of the commitment 

Aside from the legislative, supervisory, and representative function, the Assembly has and plays a great role in forming various regulatory bodies, agencies, and authorities, which are directly responsible for their work before the legislator. Starting from its establishment to the appointment of managing persons within it, members of supervisory and/or Board of Management, etc., approval of their annual operational programs, the annual financial plans to the monitoring of their work and adopting the annual operational programs, the Assembly has its role in the operation of these authorities. The Acts and documents that these authorities deliver to the Assembly in the moment are available as points, i.e. materials received in appropriate operational bodies and are available in the e-parliament system and on www.sobranie.mk. We want this commitment to create an exhaustive list of these bodies, which are now registered by officials as locally preserved lists at the Committee on Election and Appointment Issues. For that purpose, the Assembly has recognised the importance of creating a completely available inventory of these authorities, the areas of operation, the mandates of the managing persons and all attached documents that enter and upon suitable proceedings exit from the Assembly in a form that is public, available, searchable, digitalised for use and from informing the citizens, the civil organisations, academic institutions as well, etc.

Defining a problem 

2. What problem does the commitment address? 

The process of approaching the legislation of the European Union brought many areas where authorities and bodies that would act independently of the executive power in their work are explicitly required. This is important for those sectors and activities to be freed from influence in their operations and leads to the formation of a whole regulatory sphere in many areas that are directly under the authority of the legislative government, where both the majority and the opposition have a role to monitor and control in their operation. The implementation of the commitment as described will proactively provide information for the public in digital form, who those authorities and bodies are, who the appointed managers are, with what mandates with a complete set of data about them. This is expected to reduce the public's perception of the way they work, to the understanding that independent work refers to the functioning and provision of services and that everyone is part of the single administrative space in the state that is accountable to the sovereign legislative authority and the citizens. In addition, it will provide timely information about those management positions for which it is mandatory an announcement to be published by the Assembly so that the citizens be informed and possibly those who are interested can apply. And finally, editing such a list will reduce the requests for access to public information in accordance with the law, from this sphere to the Assembly, given that this information will be proactively available. For a long period of time, the public lacks information about the work of various authorities, commissions, agencies, regulators, etc. The lack of information is often connected to a public event where the media calls these authorities, and a public discourse is developed about their work that they are independent and implicitly answerable to no one. Therefore, parties concerned are citizens in the broadest sense, but especially professional organizations when they seek information as well. All of this is indirectly related to the supervisory role of the Assembly over these bodies and authorities, where it appears as the founder. 

3. What are the reasons for the problem? 

The causes of the problem are linked to the communication of newly adopted legislation in the last two decades, which resulted in many bodies and authorities with different competences. The public wants to know about these bodies, the appointment of their executives, etc. 

Description of the commitment 

1. What has been done so far for the problem to be solved? 

Information on the items of the daily agenda for the Assembly sessions are available on www.sobranie.mk. If one looks for something in terms of regulatory bodies, one looks in the sessions and agenda items, or in the search fields, but it is not possible to identify a single list of all of them and information about all of them in one place. In addition, the Assembly has a portal for open data where there is a lot of information as data sets, but these ones specifically from the commitment are not part of it. 

2. What solution are you proposing? 

The availability of this information defined in the commitment can be subject to a special registry of such data where they would be described in detail and would be available on www.sobranie.mk. Alternatively, it can be a part of a data set in the open data portal https://data.sobranie.mk/en/. We are talking about digital forms of data because now, even if there is an exhaustive list, it is not public and it is not in one place. The problem will be solved completely, because an exhaustive list of everything that exists will be given. The data will be accessible from the web directly, without having to request access to public information. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? 

The existence of a detailed register will, first of all, allow for easier monitoring of the mandates of the appointed persons, and the Assembly will be able to publish calls for appointments to the expiring positions within the deadline. It will improve predictability and efficiency. In addition, the citizens will get a real-time overview of what exists, whether action has been taken in terms of the tasks of the Assembly, then what information and reports are offered by the regulatory bodies. The MPs would have a real-time information if a condition of whether there is a specific competent authority that is directly responsible before the Assembly and not before the executive government, etc. arises in the public and the media. 

Analysis of the commitment

1.How will the commitment promote transparency? 

The implementation of the commitment will signify the processing of information that the citizens will know about in real time, which will be available electronically, searchable and will be published on a proactive basis without the need for a request for access to information or addresses to the Assembly. 

2.How will the commitment help to encourage responsibility? 

With the publication of the data, predictability is indirectly improved, especially in terms of expiration of mandates, procedure, and deadlines for new appointments, etc. With the register, information is directly provided for the deputies to exercise their constitutional rights and duties. 

3.How will the commitment improve the citizens’ participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring of the solutions? 

The implementation of the commitment will involve professional organizations that have previous analyses of the topic. In addition, in the process of co-creation and consultation, it is indirectly informed about other possibilities from websites or other software for other information. With the public on the register, we also expect more interest from the citizens in the form of a legislative idea or a question to an authorized proposer (MPs).

MK0200,North Macedonia,6,17,MKD,Europe,National,1,2024,2026,2,OPEN PARLIAMENT,INFORMING THE PUBLIC TROUGH ASSEMBLY TV CHANNEL,Informing Public Through Assembly TV Channel,"Brief description of the commitment 

The Assembly will continue the reform with the full functionality of the parliamentary channel. Informing the public through the Assembly TV channel must be of high-quality, timely, regular, predictable, through non-editable content, live broadcasts, and transmission of recordings from plenary sessions and committees, councils and other activities, but also through design and production of own content from the Assembly TV studio. The general goal of this commitment is to increase the viewership of the TV channel or indirectly increase public information about the legislative agenda.

Defining a problem 

4. What problem does the commitment address?

Communicating with the public on the legislative authority through its own television channel is a classic solution for communicating with a live camera and sound or with a recording. In this sense, the Assembly worked on the modernization of the Assembly channel, through laws amending the Law on the Assembly, with the purchase of modern equipment where 250,000 euros were invested and the employment of a professional staff of 7 people. The implementation of the commitment will enable its own content and production of a functional TV channel for the Assembly to communicate with a category of citizens who are informed about the Assembly in this way (in parallel with the website, social networks or media coverage on national televisions). Modernization and digitalisation in society over the years has made a change upon which citizens have been informed mainly from national televisions, and much less from the Assembly TV channel about what is happening in the legislature. According to some studies, there is a category of older citizens who follow the Assembly TV channel more, and a larger part of the younger population who are informed in a different way. 

2. What are the reasons for the problem? 

The reasons for this go to the easily accessible modern ways of informing through television and especially through internet portals and related news from portals to social networks. Accurate information is also important for the fight against fake news and partial and biased information. The drop in viewership of the Assembly TV channel is also related to the quality of the broadcasting itself, which has lagged behind due to lack of investment over the years. The lack of its own program such as debate shows, legislative news, etc. makes the program unattractive when there is no live broadcast from the session or recordings of working bodies. 

Description of the commitment 

1. What has been done so far for the problem to be solved? 

This commitment is a continuation of the commitment from the previous OGP Assembly Action Plan 2021-2023. Equipping the studio with modern broadcast equipment was a priority and a challenge for the service to describe, conduct and implement it as a project involving equipment, operations and premises. In addition, changes in the legal framework were necessary, and in that sense, amendments were implemented to the Law on the Assembly, where the work and competencies, the annual work program, annual plan for the type and content of the programs, the relationship with MRTV, financial and investment plan, editorial responsibility, etc. were determined more closely. The work of the studio is necessarily connected to a professional staff as well, therefore, according to the Act on the Systematisation of the Service of the Assembly, new positions were projected, and an announcement was made on two occasions for 7 vacancies. 

2. What solution are you proposing? 

The commitment projected here will enable the development of a concrete program for the work of the Assembly channel, together with the establishment of the Council of the Assembly channel which should approve all documents. The Council of the Assembly channel is a legal obligation that the TV channel of the legislator is jointly managed by the majority and the opposition. According to the law, the Council is managed by the Vice-president of the Assembly from the opposition, together with deputies from the majority and the opposition, a representative of MRTV, but also the possibility of appointing external experts with the right to speak without the right to vote. In addition to that, it will be necessary to develop content for communication with the public, which will be produced independently and/or with co-production, involving several organizational units. In this sense, we expect to develop daily legislative news, program predictability, legislative briefs/short multimedia contents in an explanatory role for the proposals for the viewers, etc., debate shows between MPs, etc. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? 

The general result of the commitment is that the proposed solutions are implemented and the Assembly channel functions. An indirect result should be an increase in viewership of the Assembly TV channel. The way in which citizens are informed is continuously monitored by the Institute for Democracy Societas Civilis in relevant surveys and studies, and that data will be taken as relevant over the years to monitor the viewership trend. https://idscs.org.mk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A4_ENG-ANKETA-2022.pdf 

Analysis of the commitment

1.How will the commitment promote transparency? 

The implementation of the commitment will signify predictability of the daily agenda of the Assembly channel (maybe of the weekly one as well). In this way, it will offer a calendar in advance for interested citizens to follow. Educational content will educate citizens on the legislative power. Debate shows will confront views and arguments. The legislative brief will provide an explanation of the proposals. 

2.How will the commitment help to encourage responsibility? 

The presence itself in a public medium helps with the sense of responsibility for what is done and said. The implementation of the activity will be directly monitored by the quality of programs on the Assembly TV channel. 

3.How will the commitment improve the citizens’ participation in defining, implementing and monitoring of the solutions? 

As part of the program activities, there will be short informational attachments for citizens, such as how to come to the Assembly and register for an open day, how to register for participation in educational activities (Children's Parliament, Imam Stav), etc.

MK0202,North Macedonia,6,19,MKD,Europe,National,1,2024,2026,2,OPEN PARLIAMENT,PARLIAMENTARY CARAVAN-Mobile Parliament for direct communication of the MPs with the citizens,Parliamentary Caravan for Citizens,"Brief description of the commitment 

The Assembly holds open days regularly and organizes visits to the building for citizens. This contributes to the process of improving the image of the institution and gradually builds the perception that the Assembly is open and transparent. However, some citizens for various reasons, weather, practical or economic, cannot travel to Skopje and visit the Assembly building. By organizing the proposed caravan, the institutional and civil partners will make the Assembly ""mobile"".

Defining a problem 

1. What problem does the commitment address? 

The main goals of the caravan are to present the Assembly as an open, responsible and transparent institution, as well as to bring it closer to those citizens who are unable to visit the building. Some of the key goals will be: • educational: adults, youth and children as well will hear information about the legislative, supervisory and other processes • promotional: meeting rooms for the caravan will be the contact offices of the MPs in order for them to be more visible to the citizens • informational: visitors to the caravan will get to know transparency initiatives, such as the new website of the Assembly, the TV studio and channel, the Parliamentary Institute, etc. • increasing visibility: the caravan will also be an opportunity to further promote the transparency and supervisory roles of the Assembly • The “Mobile Parliamentary Caravan"" is projected as a wider communication campaign and in order to maximize its visibility and reach to citizens, it will require a slogan (key message) and a visual identity • The visual identity will be developed at a later stage of the preparation process, while at this point, it is crucial to define the key message of the campaign that will also serve as the slogan of the caravan and will be conveyed in all supporting elements • Specifically, it is suggested that the slogan be simple, clear and effective, similar to the Campaign slogan ""Independent Assembly"" - and to link some parts of the key messages from those activities so that there is continuity • The proposed slogan/key message for the ""Mobile Parliamentary Caravan"" is: „Parliament for citizens"" is a very simple and clear message that everyone understands • With it, the idea is to underline that the Assembly exists for the citizens, to represent their needs, to engage in a democratic debate with them in order to draft legal solutions that will improve life both in the short and long term. • The subtitle ""Open and responsible"" (Open and responsible) will inform that the Assembly is open (as well as transparent) and that it is responsible as an institution towards the citizens. • Using 'responsible' (responsible), it will link to the subtitle of the Independent Assembly campaign which was titled 'For Representative and Responsible Governance' 

2. What are the reasons for the problem? 

The legislature, like the parliaments of the world, and the Assembly are public in their work and exposed to the opinion and insight of the public daily, at least as far as the legislative agenda is concerned. Because of that, the perceptions of the citizens are mainly related to the public events of the MPs, the proposed legal solutions, the debate and the arguments conducted, etc. In general, MPs work in Skopje, although they come from 8 electoral units and from many municipalities in the country. If we take into account the engagement with committees and plenary sessions and the work in Skopje, only Friday of the entire week is allocated for contact with those who voted for these MPs so that they can exchange ideas and hear the needs of the citizens. The commitment as projected will add more time for this direct communication with citizens 

Description of the commitment 

1. What has been done so far for the problem to be solved? 

The parliamentary caravan in an experimental form was implemented in 2022, as part of the PSP program in cooperation with NDI. In order for the activity to be implemented more than once, and for the sake of the interest of the MPs and the citizens, the proposed commitment is trying to establish it as a regular activity with a defined work curriculum. 

2. What solution are you proposing? 

Parliamentary caravan will be held in all cities where there is an office for contact with the citizens of the MPs. To each of these points, an Assembly van with employees from the Parliamentary Institute and the Assembly Service and/or MPs will travel carrying the equipment needed to set up the ""Mobile Parliament"" point - depending on the locations, or the MP's offices will be used directly or the space in front of or very close to them. The van will carry a set of: • a branded banner and a speaking stand • small stage audio and video settings (PA, microphones, TV for presentation) • foldable chairs (maximum 20) • promotional printed materials of the Parliamentary Institute With regards to the content, in any moment, the duration of the entire meeting will be around 60 minutes and it will include: • meeting minutes from a moderator • address of the local MP • educational presentation on the processes in the Assembly by a JU Representative • presentation on the activities related to transparency (web page, TV studio, safety) • moderated Question-and-Answer session 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? 

With the implementation of this commitment, the presence of MPs in their electoral municipalities will be ensured, they will promote their work and that of the Assembly, they will hear the impressions of citizens from their work and problems that require a legislative initiative, clarification of the competences of the MP against questions and problems which are under the jurisdiction of the executive authority or the local self-government. 

Analysis of the commitment 

1.How will the commitment promote transparency? 

The direct access to the citizens will show transparency by implementing this commitment. With the presence of MPs, assistants in their offices for contact with citizens, a greater visibility of the system for the needs of citizens is enabled. 

2.How will the commitment help to encourage responsibility? How will it help public institutions to become more accountable to the public? How will it facilitate the opportunity for citizens to get to know how the implementation is progressing? How will it support transparent monitoring and evaluation systems? 

Direct exposure of citizens' thoughts, ideas and criticism increases the responsibility of MPs for what they do before those who elected them. 

3.How will the commitment improve the citizens’ participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring of the solutions? How will it proactively involve the citizens and the citizen groups? 

The implementation of the commitment will produce a complete description in the form of a report of all remarks and ideas by the citizens.

Government departments/agencies and other subsidiary bodies have not been submitting timely financial statements to the Department of Finance to then submit to the Office of the Auditor General for audit and presentation to Parliament, thus resulting in PNG's annual audit reports not being made available to the public in a timely manner.; Main Objective: Make fiscal information available to the public in an accurate, comprehensive and timely manner, throughout the Budget cycle (notably, including the eight (8) principal documents widely considered fundamental to providing Budget transparency, and posted on respective government, Parliamentary and/or audit websites). This includes having full and timely annual audit reports made public on the AGO website, as well as pre-budget statements, through to In­Year, Mid-Year and Final Budget Outcome reports available, in machine­readable format, on respective government and/or Parliament websites,(notably: Treasury, which is responsible for publishing the Budget Submission and associated legislative Bills and the pre-budget through to end of year reports; the Auditor-General's website for the Audit of the public finances; the Parliament website for the certified Budget Appropriation and related Budget legislation), which provide citizens access to needed current fiscal information on: 1) The Public Accounts of PNG; 2) The Pre-Budget Statement 3) The Proposed Budget, showing forecast Budget parameters, revenue and planned expenditure, with respect to: • the National Government Departments and Agencies; • Provincial Governments and Local Level Governments; and • Statutory Authorities (and other entities operating as Authorities, including DDAs), State-owned enterprises and their Subsidiaries, and National Government Shareholdings in Other Companies 4) The Approved Budget (Appropriation and other Budget legislation) 5) In-Year Fiscal Updates 6) Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Report 7) Final Budget Outcome Report 8) A Citizens' Budget, (prepared by Treasury (and Planning) but with civil society engagement in dissemination); Complimentary Objectives: Sub-national Budget documentation and Accountability: rolling out parallel Open Budget and Accountability mechanisms and public participation at the Provincial, District and LLG levels, with Open Government Partnership principles (with DoF, DPLGA, DIRD, with CIMC and other civil society entities) • Public Participation: As per the separate Public Participation cluster, t­ensure systematic public engagement throughout the Budget preparatio and oversight phases, (including through the CIMC consultation process). notably with the Executive through routine public availability (online) c Budget material and invitation to the public to contribute views, priorities and feedback through the Budget cycle, and with the audit process (with th Auditor-General's Office) and oversight mechanisms with the Legislature, notably through the Budget and Parliamentary Public Accounts Committe1 Also consultation and engagement in longer term planning and oversighL mechanisms, including medium term development and fiscal plannin­processes, at national and sub-national levels, • Open Public Procurement: Adhere to the principles of Open Contracting Global Principles in public procurement (and with othe agreements/contracting/licensing undertaken by the State), including public disclosure of documents at all stages of contracting, consistent wit the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS); notably: • Affirmative Disclosure, namely the commitment to affirmative) disclose of documents and information related to publk contracting in a manner that enables meaningful understandinr and • Public Participation, Monitoring and Oversight to enable effective monitoring, efficient performance and accountabilit outcomes Le2islature En2a2ement: Ensure Parliamentary engagement at differer._ stages of the Budget cycle, from drafting to public accounts oversight. 
Another objective which is important is to maintain PNG's eligibility as a member of the OGP, in terms of the specified criteria, and to progressive]·· improve standards, and enable PNG to exercise a leadership role in governanc issues in the region.; Brief Description of Commitment: The commitment is focused upon the timely and comprehensive pubh. provision and public release of fiscal details, throughout the budget cycle, right through to the audit of public funds, to enable the public to engage meaningfull in the budget process, from its preparation stages through to contributing to holding the government accountable, at national and local levels, for th efficient use of public funds in the public interest. Engagement by Parliamer with the public and through the budget process, and full transparency in public procurement and other contracting are also critical to effective and accountable government operations. Section 214 (1) of the Constitution states that ""The primary functions of the Auditor-General are to inspect and audit, and report at least once in every fiscal year (as provided by an Act of the Parliament) to the Parliament on the public accounts of Papua New Guinea, and on the control of and on transactions with or concerning the public monies and property of Papua New Guinea, and such other functions as are prescribed by or under a Constitutional Law"". Although the Constitution states for the Office of the Auditor General to inspect, audit and report to Parliament on the public accounts of PNG at least once in every fiscal year, it is clearly evident that this is not the case.; OGP Grand Challenge address by the Commitment: Increasing Public Integrity -This commitment to providing timely, accurate and accessible fiscal data is expected to contribute towards greater transparency and allow PNG citizens to monitor better the source and use of public resources. It would also help to reduce opportunities for fraud, corruption and waste, and gives citizens power to follow the money.; Relevance - Briefly describe the way in which this commitment is relevant to further advancing OGP values of access to information, public accountability, civic participation, and technology and innovation for openness and accountability: Fiscal Transparency is one of the four main eligibility criteria for joining the OGP. Any country wishing to participate in OGP needs to meet minimum eligibility requirements. Having timely annual audit reports made public is a requirement of the OGP. PNG is currently eligible to participate in OGP with a score of 12 out of 16 possible points. However, the Open Budget Survey, from which the OGP draws its data, shows that PNG has lost 2 points because the government's audit report has not been made publically available. Improving the openness and comprehensiveness of budget and procurement details in a timely manner, associated with the OGP National Action Plan, to achieve positive governance improvement, would also raise PNG status in various international governance indicators (including the Open Budget Index, etc); Ambition: Briefly describe the intended results of the commitment and how it will either make government open or improve government through more openness: This commitment aims to ensure that details on public monies and resources (including borrowings) from the planning stage through to actual expenditure and audits, entailing National Government departments/agencies, Provinces and local governments, public authorities and other State owned bodies and their subsidiaries, are made available in a comprehensive and timely manner for the citizens of PNG, and that associated processes with respect to the utilisation of public finance and resources, including public procurement and contracting, are released full and promptly It is also intended that this commitment will lead to improving financial transparency and management practices within Government departments/agencies and other subsidiary bodies.; Variable and Measurable milestones to fulfill the commitment: Milestone 1 -Audit of Public Accounts. Audit compliance from timely submissions of comprehensive financial statements to AGO, to timely release of the reports of Public Account to Parliament and the public (which in turn requires adequate funding and human resources); Milestone 2 -Rollout the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) to all government bodies including sub-national level in accordance with schedule, to facilitate timely updates and sound management of public funds; Milestone 3 -Parliamentary oversight. For Treasury & Finance to engage meaningfully with a Parliamentary Committee on the Budget during preparation of the Budget, and for an adequately resourced Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee to engage with respective public bodies on the outcomes of the Audit reports, and to engage in turn with Civil Society.; Milestone 4 -Providing in-year fiscal reports on the Treasury website. Produce and release publicly monthly, or initially at least quarterly, fiscal update reports.; Milestone 5 -Following approval of new Public Procurement Policy, draft apply legislation on public contracting which adheres to the principles of Open Contracting, whereby the process is open, competitive and entails full public disclosure and provides adequate time equally for all prospective applications/ proposals/ bids/ to be prepared and submitted, with the public having full access to the tender documents, details of potential bidders and their interest and beneficial ownership, and the process and outcomes of the tender, or other public contracting arrangements.; Milestone 6 a- Develop a Citizens' Budget- Government to produce a clear, but simpler and explanatory version of the budget in summary explaining 1) the economic assumptions underlying the budget; 2) the budget process; 3) revenue collection; 4) debt repayment as a share of the budget; 5) priorities in allocations and spending; 6) official development assistance sources; 7) sector-specific information and information about targeted programs; 8) sub- national allocations and for what purpose; 9) contact information for follow up by citizens. Government to make Citizens' Budget available for wide public dissemination, by government or civil society bodies, across the provinces and into rural areas. Relevant data on related revenue or expenditure for the two preceding years to be provided. (This will also provide a model for future Citizen's Budgets at the sub-national level); Milestone 6b - Dept. of Treasury, Finance, National Planning, together with CIMC, to design and implement a system for timely and systematic participation by the public in the Budget process, from preparation through to oversight, with CIMC, INA, TIPNG and other CSOs, to undertake public awareness about the budget process and composition, including the Budget outcomes, and requirements under the Public Finances (Management) Act, as revised.; Milestone 7a -CIMC with TIPNG and other CSOs undertake budget tracking/social auditing activities at sub-national level. Schedule 6 districts per year. Milestone 7b - TIPNG, CIMC & INA with sub­national CSOs work with, oversight organisations such as the Auditor General and Ombudsman Commission to encourage public feedback on public financial management concerns and complaints. Milestone 7c - Joint Milestone facilitated through the Public Participation Cluster; Dept of Finance and other Govt bodies, Audit General Office and Parliament to cooperate with Civil Society bodies (notably CIMC, TIPNG, & INA and sub-national CSOs) to help design/apply suitable feedback mechanisms (e.g. Civil Society Forums, PNGRGC, etc.) for feedback on public sector accountability, and public goods/service standards etc.",1/1/2018,12/31/2021,"Department of Treasury, Auditor General's Office","• Dr. Ken Ngangan, Department of Finance

 ¿Cuál es la problemática que el compromiso aborda? 
 Hay esfuerzos significativos en términos de participación ciudadana, pero también notorias debilidades como la ausencia de normativa legal que establezca la obligación de las instituciones públicas de implementar mecanismos de participación ciudadana, y la existencia de muchas instancias de participación ciudadana que no cumplen con estándares mínimos de calidad, en términos de inclusión, calidad del debate e incidencia ciudadana en las decisiones.
 ¿Cuál es el compromiso?
 Fortalecer la calidad de la participación ciudadana a través de a) una ley de participación ciudadana que establezca las obligaciones de las instituciones públicas en materia de participación ciudadana y estándares mínimos de calidad; b) Creación de un observatorio de participación ciudadana que pueda servir para diagnosticar, evaluar y recomendar mejoras en los mecanismos de participación ciudadana existentes a nivel país, incluyendo la calidad de participación ciudadana en los compromisos de este Plan de Gobierno Abierto; c) Implementar experiencias de calidad en la participación ciudadana a través de un piloto de presupuesto participativo en la Municipalidad de Encarnación que represente un avance en relación a las experiencias existentes, el fortalecimiento de 40 consejos de desarrollo y mecanismos de participación ciudadana en la formulación de planes de ordenamiento territorial en 10 municipios.
 ¿Cómo contribuirá a resolver la problemática?
 La implementación de todas las acciones que forman parte de este compromiso permitirá mejorar la calidad de la participación ciudadana.
 ¿Por qué es relevante a los valores de OGP?
 Es relevante para el principio de participación ciudadana de gobierno abierto.

 Ministerio de Tecnologías de la Información y Comunicación (MITIC)
 ¿Cuál es la problemática que el compromiso aborda? 
 Existen trámites no normalizados complejos, burocráticos, aislados y costosos para los ciudadanos. Los usuarios no acceden adecuadamente a la información sobre los requerimientos del trámite y sobre el estado de la solicitud, con lo cual existe falta de transparencia. Al no haber información adecuada sobre el estado de la solicitud, la institución pública no rinde cuentas eficientemente de su trabajo a los usuarios.
 Actualmente solo el 2% de los trámites del Estado se encuentran disponibles en formatos electrónicos, o al menos parcialmente en línea por medio de una computadora, celular o tablet.
 Esta cobertura es baja comparando con países de la región en donde los trámites total o parcialmente en línea rondan un promedio del 7%. Para generar cambios en este ámbito es necesario trabajar aún más. 
 Además de la gestión del cambio en las propias instituciones que deben ofrecer sus servicios por estos canales digitales, es fundamental el marco legal habilitante de este tipo de iniciativas.
 El mejoramiento del marco legal reforzaría la función del MITIC en cuanto a sus atribuciones legales para propiciar y emitir directrices para la optimización de los trámites y procesos, y para la interoperabilidad entre las entidades del Poder Ejecutivo, así como para lograr una incidencia directa en el fortalecimiento de la eficacia, eficiencia y transparencia de las prestaciones y servicios públicos.
 ¿Cuál es el compromiso? 
 Formular de manera participativa una propuesta de reglamentación de la Ley de Trámites Administrativos N° 4679 para su promulgación por medio de un decreto de la Presidencia de la República.
 ¿Cómo contribuirá a resolver la problemática?
 El compromiso contribuirá a disponer de información actualizada sobre los pasos, requisitos, tiempos, modalidades, costos y herramientas tecnológicas disponibles para cada trámite ofrecido por los organismos y entidades del Estado, y sobre el estado de la solicitud realizada, que facilite la interacción con los ciudadanos usuarios en su relacionamiento con las instituciones por redes electrónicas, ofreciendo calidad, eficiencia, simplicidad, accesibilidad, comodidad y ahorros.
 
 
 ¿Por qué es relevante a los valores de OGP?
 La simplificación de trámites es relevante para los principios de transparencia y rendición de cuentas. Permite a los usuarios acceder a información sobre los requerimientos para realizar un trámite, adoptar decisiones en base a la información y acceder a datos e informaciones sobre el estado de solicitud a lo largo del proceso iniciado con las instituciones públicas con quienes interactúe, tanto por canales presenciales, telefónicos, electrónicos, o una combinación de los mismos.
 Al conocer el estado de su solicitud paso a paso, el usuario estará controlando la gestión de la institución y la institución informando y rindiendo cuenta de su gestión.

Las leyes que aprueba el Congreso de la República por lo general se publican y difunden en idioma castellano. En el Perú, el Quechua es uno de los idiomas oficiales (artículo 48 de la Constitución Política del Perú) que, según resultados del Censo Nacional XII de Población y VII de Vivienda de 2017, el 13,9% de la población nacional (3 millones 735 mil 682 personas) han declarado al Quechua como idioma aprendido en la niñez, el 1,7% Aymara y el 0,8% aprendió otra lengua nativa. Además, de acuerdo al XII Censo de Población, VII de Vivienda y III de Comunidades Indígenas 2017, la mayoría de personas monolingües que solamente son hablantes de una lengua indígena son mujeres. Las leyes que aprueba el Congreso de la República rigen la vida de todas y todos los peruanos y lamentablemente no todos y todas cuentan con las mismas habilidades para conocer dichas leyes como consecuencia de algún tipo de discapacidad o limitación física. En el Perú, el 10,4% de la población nacional (3 millones 51 mil 612 personas) padecen de algún tipo de discapacidad o limitación física y/o mental. Al 2017, del total de población que presenta alguna discapacidad, el 81,5% (2 millones 487 mil 690) tienen una sola discapacidad y el 18,5% (563 mil 922) dos o más discapacidades. De acuerdo al tipo de discapacidad, el 48,3% (1 millón 473 mil 583) presenta dificultad para ver, el 15,1% (462 mil 60) para moverse o caminar, el 7,6% (232 mil 176) problema para oír, el 4,2% (127 mil 947) dificultad para entender o aprender, el 3,2% (98 mil 836) dificultad para relacionarse con los demás, el 3,1% (93 mil 88) dificultad para hablar o comunicarse. 

¿Cuál es el compromiso? 

Dentro de la información en materia legislativa que se publica y difunde en la plataforma digital del Congreso de la República “Archivo Digital de la Legislación del Perú”, se prevé incorporar (1) distintos formatos y medios utilizables para presentar las leyes traducidas al Quechua y (2) distintos formatos y medios utilizables para las personas con discapacidad visual o auditiva. 

¿Cómo el compromiso va a contribuir a solucionar el problema? 

El cumplimiento del presente compromiso permitirá que grupos vulnerables de la población pueden acceder y conocer directamente las leyes que aprueba el Congreso de la República, en beneficio de sus derechos como ciudadanos y ciudadanas. 

¿Por qué el compromiso es relevante a los principios de Gobierno Abierto? 

El compromiso apunta a establecer un canal de información oportuno y eficiente con la ciudadanía, en la que pueda conocer las leyes que rigen el país, en formato amigable, inclusivo, con pertinencia cultural, accesible al público con discapacidad visual o auditiva y población en general y en favor de un uso académico, particular u otro.

In order to fortify the budget process, there has always been a need to introduce budget reforms that will enforce greater accountability in public financial management (PFM).; What is the commitment?: This commitment aims to reform the budget process by enforcing greater accountability in public financial management, strengthening Congress’ power of the purse, instituting an integrated PFM system, and increasing budget transparency and participation. This will be done by improving the Philippines’ performance in the Open Budget Survey and shepherding the passage of the Budget Reform Bill (BRB) in Congress. The BRB aims to strengthen Congress’ power of the purse by enforcing the Constitutional policy that all expenditures must be approved by Congress; and by enabling Congress to review and approve proposed appropriations based clearly defined performance information and regular reports on actual performance. The Bill also secures the irreversibility of PFM reforms so far established by COA, DBM, DOF, NEDA.; How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem?: The increase in the country’s OBS performance will address identified fiscal openness gaps with concrete actions from government. While the establishment of a legal framework for the Public Financial Management will strengthen accountability and integrity in the use of public resources. It will: (1) enforce transparency, fiscal responsibility, resultsorientation, efficiency & effectiveness thru an integrated PFM system; (2) enforce power of purse of Congress to authorize appropriations, & responsibility of all agencies to propose, execute and deliver results committed in the Budget; (3) promote citizen empowerment via fiscal transparency & participation; (4) integrate planning, budgeting, and performance management & ensure ample safeguards in managing public finances through the creation of an Office of Comptroller General; (5) Enhance transparency & participation through the reporting to, and monitoring by Congress, and the public.; Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?: Transparency The bill seeks to provide mechanism for better people’s access to Public Financial Information through publication of a Calendar of Disclosures. Likewise, it shall institutionalize the publication of citizen-friendly summaries of the following: Statement of Fiscal Policy, Proposed national Budget, General Appropriations Law, and the Annual Fiscal Report Civic participation The bill also seeks to increase People’s Participation in the Budget Process by establishing and implementing suitable participatory budget mechanisms to facilitate the open, inclusive, and meaningful engagement of citizens throughout the budget process—from budget preparation, to legislation, to execution, and to accountability and audit. Such participatory mechanisms may include consultations and partnerships with civil society organizations (CSOs), academics and experts, and other individual and organized stakeholders throughout the annual budget process. Public Accountability The Bill shall ensure Financial Management and Internal Control by establishing the Office of the Comptroller General to oversee the operation of an integrated internal control framework across Government Technology and innovation for openness and accountability All documents and reports required to be published shall automatically be made available electronically in a government website. Current and historical data on government revenues, expenditures, and borrowings, shall be made more comprehensive, available electronically, in open data format, on a government website. The development of an Integrated Financial Management Information System will automate the financial transactions of all government agencies and assure the timely availability of accurate reports on these to the President, Congress, and the public.; Additional information: This commitment is in line with Chapter 5 of the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022 on Ensuring People-Centered, Clean, and Efficient Governance.",6/30/2017,6/30/2019,Department of Budget and Management,"1.

This results to most people being unaware of the ordinances passed in the Saggunian, excluding them in the decision-making process of the Sanggunian. If there are public hearings conducted for the passing of an ordinance, a limited few attends the public hearing due to lack of interest and/or the inaccessibility of the venue for the public hearing. This leads to low citizen participation in the creation of legislations. In addition, although CSOs are members of the local special bodies, their participation in the legislation process is also very limited. Looking at the current context of the local legislation process, it can be observed that there is low citizen participation due to lack of interest, inaccessibility of the public hearings for the ordinances and inadvertent exclusion of some citizens.; What is the commitment?: The commitment aims to create more spaces for citizen engagement to further improve the local legislative process.; How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem?: A highly accessible and transparent local government through open legislative processes will increase the citizens’ participation through public awareness and spaces for engagement between the public and the government.; Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?: This alternative process will supplement the current offline legislative events such as committee hearings and public assemblies. Leveraging technology through an online platform, specifically through social media, the citizen’s interest on legislation will improve and in effect improving the citizen’s participation. Social media, such as Facebook, is a more accessible medium for the citizens as most citizens have active Facebook accounts.

PH0056,Philippines,5,1,PHL,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2019,2022,3,NA,Support for the Local Governance Program and Fiscal Openness Program,Citizen Participation in Local Government,"What is the problem the commitment will address?

The legal framework in the Philippines is conducive to citizen participation in governance. The country is host to thousands of non-government organizations that are already engaging with the government at the national and local level, in different phases of the governance cycle. Articles II, X, and XIII of the 1987 Constitution put emphasis to the promotion and protection of the rights of the people and civil society organizations and platforms for ""effective and reasonable participation at all levels of social, political and economic decision-making."" The Local Government Code of 1991 and the annual General Appropriations Act also supports and highlights the need to provide spaces and appropriate policies for citizen engagement in governance at the local level. 

However, a number of civil society and even government stakeholders have raised that the spirit of these legal frameworks, laws, and policies are not adequately reflected in actual practice, or if so, the outputs and outcomes of meaningful citizen engagement are not adequately and appropriately documented and/or measured. 

Despite the establishment of various local, regional and national structures and mechanisms to promote and mainstream meaningful citizen engagement in governance, recent policy discussions, stakeholder consultations,  and several studies in this governance area have identified the following governance gaps between policy issuance and effective policy implementation both at the national and local levels of government: 
1.        There is a weak system in documenting citizens participation in national and local governance;
2.        The use of technology in governance, particularly in the area of citizens engagement, is not fully maximized;
3.        There is a need for providing more platforms to inform the citizens of the state of local governance in their respective local governments
While there is recognition of the accomplishments of government in promoting transparency and establishing functional citizen feedback mechanisms, global governance data on corruption and participatory governance indicate persistence of corruption and shrinking space for civil society as continuing main challenges to the promotion of genuine democracy in the Philippines. 
To address these challenges, existing open and participatory governance mechanisms need to be designed and implemented in such a way that  it can lead to more concrete and transformative outcomes

What is the commitment?

The commitment is mainly to strengthen citizen participation in governmental process. This shall be attained through various initiatives on improving local governance and fiscal openness program being implemented under the Department of the Interior and Local Government and the Department of Budget and Management. 

In particular, the commitment shall contribute to addressing the public problem identified above by way of the following:
1.        Issuance and implementation of National policy on civil society participation in governance;
2.        Implementation of Civic Technology for Governance Innovations through Citizen Feedback System (Development Live);
3.        Conduct of Town Hall Meetings (Regional, Provincial and Municipal Level)
4.        Oversee local governments in promoting the establishment and operation of people’s and non-governmental organizations 

The commitment implementation will advance all OGP values of access to information, public accountability, civic participation, and leveraging technology for better governance.  
The commitment shall support the fulfillment of the major milestones set in the PGC Resolution No. 1 s. 2019. In particular, this commitment shall contribute to the achievement of the following governance priorities: 
1.        Ensuring that a portion of the National and Local Budget is intended to support the participation of citizens and civil society in various governance initiatives;
2.        Issuance of a National Policy on Civil Society Engagement in Governance;
3.        Enforcement of NGA and LGU compliance to pertinent provisions of existing laws related to peoples’ participation in governance; and
4.        Implementation of Civic Technology initiatives in government at the National and Local level.

Section 7 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution emphasizes the right of the people to information on matters of public concern. However, 30 years since the first Freedom of Information (FOI) Bill was filed, the Philippine Congress has yet to pass a legislation that promotes access to information. 

Lack of transparency and accountability which may contribute to corruption and inefficient public service delivery are a few of the major problems this commitment will address. Low (or lack of) participation from citizens due to lack of knowledge or information on how the government operates may also be addressed. Direct participation also constitutes a big challenge on account of large and growing population, thus, this commitment will also address insufficient mechanisms to promote and enhance citizen participation.  

As of this writing, here are the developments: 
●        On July 2016, President Duterte signed Executive Order No. 2, s. 2016 (EO 2) entitled “Operationalizing in the Executive Branch the People’s Constitutional Right to Information and the State Policies of Full Public Disclosure and Transparency in the Public Service and Providing Guidelines Therefor”.
●        On October 2018, the PCOO and the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) issued a Joint Memorandum Circular reiterating EO 2 to the local government units. As of date, twenty (20) LGUs have successfully passed their ordinances: Province of Ilocos Norte; Province of Benguet; Province of Surigao Del Norte; Province of Bohol; Province of Masbate; Province of La Union; Province of Occidental, Mindoro;Municipality of Pakil, Laguna; Municipality of Torrijos, Marinduque; Municipality of San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte; Municipality of Infanta, Quezon; Municipality of Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro; Municipality of San Roque, Northern Samar; Municipality of Consolocion, Cebu; Pasig City; Laoag City, Ilocos Norte; Tuguegarao City; Antipolo City, Rizal; Legazpi City, Albay; and, Quezon City. 
●        Both chambers of Congress in the Philippines have their separate versions of the Freedom of Information Bill.
●        In the second quarter of 2019, the FOI-PMO of the PCOO conducted stakeholder consultations with civil society organizations and non-government organizations regarding the draft Admin Version of the FOI Bill.
●        On 15 July 2019, the FOI-PMO endorsed the Admin Version of the FOI Bill to the 18th Congress.
●        On 21 August 2019, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Alexei Nograles declared the FOI Bill as one of the priority bills, as identified by the Participatory Governance Cluster

What is the commitment?

To have Congress pass a legislation on access to information which will mandate the disclosure of government information—from all three branches to the general public. In the interim, to sustain and further expand the reach of the EO 2, the PCOO will strengthen its efforts on implementing access to information at the local level. The passage of a Freedom of Information Law is crucial for Filipino citizens to exercise their right to access government-held information. It empowers citizen participation in demanding for transparency and accountability from the government. The Law will mandate all branches of the government to disclose all documents as well as the procedures for accessing these documents.

December 2018 – 2020
Lead implementing agency/actor Scottish Exchequer (Scottish Government) and related Scottish Government teams including: • Public Spending • Infrastructure and Investment • Financial Management Directorate • Performance and Strategic Outcomes • Tax • Scottish National Investment Bank • Economy Commitment description What is the public problem that the commitment will address? New powers were devolved to Scotland through the 2012 and 2016 Scotland Acts. These provided significant additional tax, spending and borrowing responsibilities for the Scottish Government. In addition, there is growing public and Parliamentary interest in financial transparency and how financial management relates to performance against the National Performance Framework and Sustainable Development Goals. This includes tax policy, including how it compares to international comparators and to other parts of the UK, in economic performance which influences tax revenues and demand for public services, in borrowing decisions, and in contractual and spending patterns all of which support public services in Scotland. The establishment of a Scottish National Investment Bank provides an opportunity to establish trusted governance from the outset. Similarly, this applies to the newly-established Scottish Exchequer.
What is the commitment? This Scottish Government commitment is: • To apply open government policies and practice to the further design and implementation of the newly established Scottish Exchequer and the development of the Scottish National Investment Bank to ensure they develop in line with international good practice on open government. It is proposed that the Scottish National Investment Bank’s operations include an Ethical Statement, and a role for citizen involvement in an Advisory Group. Both of these proposed approaches have the potential and intent to inform thinking around the Bank’s governance and wider accountability as well as improving citizen participation. • To seek the views of stakeholders and the wider public about how to make Scotland’s public finances more transparent and accessible in order to promote public discussion, debate and participation in financial and policy decision making. This will include learning from young people, primarily through working with YoungScot. The Scottish Government will work with partners and expert civil society actors to review and incorporate good practice on transparency, accountability and citizen engagement into the work of the Scottish Exchequer. This will include a number of round table events to bring together experts on fiscal transparency to share learning and understanding. • To build on the work of the first Open Government Partnership Action Plan, in order to improve the effectiveness of budgetary information in communicating with external audiences. This commitment will also include building on the work that is ongoing to deliver the recommendations of the recent Budget Process Review Group (BPRG) Report 2017. The report proposed that the Scottish Parliament’s budget process should have the following four core objectives: • to have a greater influence on the formulation of the Scottish Government’s budget proposals
• to improve transparency and raise public understanding and awareness of the budget • to respond effectively to new fiscal and wider policy challenges • to lead to better outputs and outcomes as measured against benchmarks and stated objectives. We, the Scottish Government, will begin with developing accessible financial information for young people, as we know from feedback that they do not find current information on public finances informative. So, taking action to build understanding now will be an important foundation for future citizenship. The first stage will involve project working with young people in deliberative workshops over the coming 6 months to provide insights into the questions they wish to see addressed. One key aim of work to implement the BPRG recommendations (outlined above) will be to find ways of making clearer links between public finance decisions and the National Performance Framework and Sustainable Development Goals. This commitment will also include: • consideration of how budget information could complement participatory budgeting • consideration of how the strategy and processes of the Scottish National Investment Bank are able to be understood and influenced by citizens • improving transparency on what government spends and the contracts and services it procures. We will explore if and how the existing data can be shared to help citizens understand how public funds are spent and making this information more accessible – using more visual presentations of the information, and plain language.
How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? Those in Scottish Government who hold the financial information and support the decision-taking processes will understand from others – initially, from young people and also from experts – the questions they have about public finances. They should then be able to use that understanding to improve financial information that is made publicly available. Importantly this work will support the aim for the Scottish National Investment Bank to fulfil a leadership role in terms of building public trust, diversity, equality, transparency and accountability. Publishing better information on procurement processes and spend should help people better understand how the money is used and accounted for, and more easily be able to understand information that is published. Why is this commitment relevant to Open Government Partnership values? In delivering this commitment the Scottish Government will advance its commitment to all four Open Government Partnership values of Transparency, Accountability, Participation and Technology and Innovation. The delivery of this commitment will build on the new financial information produced by the Scottish Government through its new Medium Term Financial Strategy, its new Fiscal Framework Outturn Report, the Scotland’s Finances publication and the redesigned Scottish Budget document, which aim to increase the clarity, format and range of publicly available information on how Scotland’s Budget is agreed and spent. Additional information This commitment is core to the values in Scotland’s National Performance Framework and supports the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals by seeking to articulate more clearly the link between performance information and fiscal decisions. It is a fundamental part of the Scottish Government’s commitment to delivery of new devolved powers in Scotland in a ways that are transparent and open.
Milestone Activity with a verifiable deliverable Start Date End Date: Scottish National Investment Bank adopts Open Government principles and culture and explores setting up the following: • Citizen Advisory Group • Develops Ethical Statement with public participation and input Spring 2019 2020 Young people’s understanding of Public Finances Report – with YoungScot – will be published. December 2018 Summer 2019 The Spending Review will be completed by December 2019 in time for Budget 2020-21. A new development in transparency for the Spending Review will be the publication of a Spending Review Framework by June 2019, which will set out the economic and political context, the criteria which will govern the assessment of budgets and the process and timetable for the review. This is in line with the Budget Process Review Group Report (recommendation 4), and is intended to amongst other things to support Parliamentary Committees in undertaking ‘a constructive dialogue with the Government, public bodies and stakeholders… in order to influence the outcome of the spending review’. December 2018 Spring 2019
We have committed to progress on making closer links with outcomes and the budget over the years ahead. Key milestones are each successive Scottish Budget, which would usually be published in December each year for the forthcoming financial year. Indicators of progress would be: • commentary and analysis in the Budget document showing how spending contributes to intermediate outputs, measures and milestones set for new policies – with the outcomes those policies we are aiming to achieve set out clearly at the time they were announced; • a clearer link between policies and plans and the Budget document to show how the allocation of resources contributes to priorities, long-term aims and outcomes.

Description of Commitment
Problem addressed by the
commitment
The Constitution of the Republic of Serbia guarantees citizens the
right to propose laws. On the other hand, the Law on Referendum
and Civic Initiatives guarantees citizens the right to propose
amendments to the Constitution, laws, other regulations and
general acts within the purview of the National Assembly and the
assemblies of autonomous provinces, municipalities or cities, to
call for referendum on specific issues and submit other petitions in
accordance with the Constitution, laws and statutes. However,
citizens have no means of swift, ready and simple participation in
these processes. The currently applicable law from 1994 imposes
very strict conditions for citizens’ participation in these processes. 
60
Citizens therefore rarely opt to exercise their rights by submitting
civic initiatives or supporting certain civic initiatives.
Main objective As the Law on Referendum and Civic Initiatives is currently being
amended, one step further should be made and all existing forms
of civic engagement should be enabled electronically. Developed
online models for civic participation should be copied and citizens
should be allowed to submit initiatives and/or petitions
themselves, using a single platform.
How will this commitment
contribute to problem solving?
According to a survey conducted by the organisation CRTA, very
few citizens believe their personal engagement can change
anything in their society and their environment. On the other hand,
the same survey reported a mild increase in the share of citizens
who stated a desire and willingness to actively influence decisionmaking processes (from 25%, in 2014 this share increased to 34%
in 2016). Accordingly, it should be made possible for citizens to
participate in social processes in an easy, simple and efficient
manner.
A specific aspect of this commitment is that it would allow
citizens to submit initiatives and/or petitions by themselves using
this mechanism, which would be forwarded to the competent
institutions for discussion and decision-making if they are
supported by sufficient online signatures.
The way in which this
commitment is relevant to
further advancing OGP values
Implementation of electronic forms of civic engagement would
improve citizens’ participation in the decision-making process.
The existing forms of civic engagement do not keep up with the
trends in terms of electronic participation and e-communications
and has been shown on several occasions to be too complicated
for broad civic participation.
Additional information The Action Plan on Implementation of the Public Administration
Reform Strategy 2018-2020 provides for the commissioning of a
comparative practice study and subsequent amendments to the
Law on Civic Initiatives and Referendum in order to improve
mechanisms for civic engagement.

Lead implementing agency: National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia

Description

Public opinion surveys and focus group results indicate there is a
need to improve knowledge of the public participation mechanisms
which exist under the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly
of the Republic of Serbia. An improvement in this area would help
build trust in the parliament. The mechanism of sessions outside the
headquarters of the National Assembly should ensure greater
participation of the civil sector (citizens and civil society), to improve
as much as possible access to information on the work of
representative bodies. So far, citizens and civil society representatives
have not sufficiently participated actively in the discussions during
the sessions of parliamentary committees outside the headquarters,
nor have they made sufficient use of the opportunities to make
proposals and ask questions to members of parliamentary
committees, national deputies and representatives of the executive
who attend parliamentary committee sessions.

Main objective: To establish two-way communication with citizens via a separate
section of the National Assembly website dedicated to sessions
outside of the headquarters, in order to give citizens and
representatives of the civil society opportunities to raise issues they observed in their local communities. Specifically, the National
Assembly will develop a subpage through which citizens and civil
society representatives will be able to contact the relevant
parliamentary committee and submit their proposals or questions in
this way. Parliamentary committees of the National Assembly will
plan their sessions outside the headquarters on the basis of such
proposals.
Parliamentary committees of the National Assembly will enable
attendance and participation of representatives of citizens and civil
society organisations at committee sessions outside of the
headquarters when specific issues within the purview of the relevant
committee are discussed. Participation will be ensured through a
contact form on the subpage dedicated to sessions outside the
headquarters, which will create an opportunity for citizens and at
least one representative of the civil society to attend sessions outside
the headquarters.

How will this activity contribute to problemsolving?
In line with the principle of parliamentary transparency, the general
public would have access to parliamentary committees of the
National Committees, which would ensure two-way communication
with citizens. This would give citizens and civil society
representatives an opportunity to highlight specific issues, which
could potentially result in legislative amendments.
Attendance at parliamentary committee sessions would enable them
to participate in the discussion, make proposals and ask questions to
members of parliamentary committees, national deputies and
representatives of the executive who attend parliamentary committee
sessions.

The way in which this activity is relevant to further advancing OGP values?

This activity is relevant for civic participation, transparency and
public accountability, as values promoted and fostered by the Open
Government Partnership. Implementation of the activity will lead to
greater involvement of civil society organisations and citizens in
decision-making, allowing them to highlight specific issues through
two-way communication so that legislative provisions could be
amended as appropriate, as well as to greater visibility of issues at the
local level. Two-way communication promotes and contributes to
greater interest and involvement of civil society organisations and
citizens and awareness of the parliament’s work, which is conductive
to further development of mutual understanding and citizens’ trust of
the government.

RS0065,Serbia,5,11,SRB,Europe,National,1,2023,2027,4,NA,"Recommendation: Modernization and improvement of the accessibility of contents, information and data on the website of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia",Web Modernization for the National Assembly,"Brief description of the Commitment 

The recommendation implies the improvement of the proactive transparency of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia through the redesign and modernization of its website, the introduction of new contents and new publication formats (when possible), in accordance with the previously analysed needs. It is expected that such an approach to the wider public, i.e. to all stakeholders, shall significantly facilitate the availability and accessibility of contents, information and data resulting from the work of the National Assembly, as well as from the work of other state authorities, organizations and bodies.

Problem Definition

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? As the supreme representative body and the holder of constitutional and legislative power, the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia has a particularly important role in the society, and thus the public's interest in its work is constantly at a high level. Publicity of work is regulated by the provisions of the Law on the National Assembly (""Official Gazette of the RS"", No. 9/10) and the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly (""Official Gazette of the RS"", No. 20/12), which prescribe numerous mechanisms for informing the public. Modern methods of information place a special emphasis on providing information through websites, regardless of which entities are involved, i.e. whether it is a state authority or an entity belonging to another sector. Bearing in mind the constitutional and legislative competence, the electoral, control and representative functions of the National Assembly, as well as the intensive dynamics of work, a number of different types of content are available on the website of the National Assembly (http://www.parlament.gov.rs/), as well as a large amount of information and data derived from its work, as well as from the work of other state authorities, organizations and bodies. However, due to the constant need to publish new content in order to achieve a higher level of transparency, it was noted that the existing website does not allow for easy access to all the contents, data and information found on it and is more difficult to perform search, so there are numerous challenges in figuring out how new information and data will be introduced and published on it. 

2. What are the causes of the problem? The main cause of the current situation stems from the fact that the existing website of the National Assembly was created more than 10 years ago, in accordance with the needs and technical possibilities and capacities at the time, which have changed significantly since then.

Commitment Description

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? The National Assembly Service, i.e., the competent Editorial Board of the National Assembly website and the competent Public Relations Department, have for years been proactive in overcoming the issue of difficulty finding of contents, information and data on the website. In this direction, there is a constant effort to find creative solutions in order to introduce new features on the existing website, within the existing possibilities. One of the most demanding solutions, which proved to be very successful in practice, was the introduction of live streaming of sessions of the National Assembly, sessions of working bodies in and outside the seat of the National Assembly, as well as of other activities organized by the National Assembly. 

2. What solution are you proposing? As a solution to the problem, it is proposed to improve the website of the National Assembly, which will make it easier to find and search the contents, information and data published on it. In this way, the large amount of contents, information and data that goes ""into the depths"" of the website will be more accessible to everyone (MPs and employees of the National Assembly Service, state authorities, organizations and bodies, media representatives, representatives of civil society, citizens and others). Accordingly, the solution includes:  redesign of the website of the National Assembly;  uploading CVs of MPs on the website of the National Assembly (given that MPs are not legally obliged to submit their CVs for publication on the website, MPs will be offered, if they so wish, to submit CVs on the form which shall be prescribed by the Editorial Board of the National Assembly website, with a disclaimer that the National Assembly and the National Assembly Service are not responsible for the content of the published CVs of MPs on the website);  uploading of acts in searchable formats (when possible, bearing in mind that proposers submit draft laws and other acts in various non-searchable formats). As with the creation of the existing website, the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia, the Law on the National Assembly and the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly, as well as the internal acts of the National Assembly Service and the Editorial Board of the National Assembly website, shall be adhered to during the redesign of the National Assembly website. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? The described improvement of the website of the National Assembly will enable the contents, data and information that already exist on the website to be more accessible and visible, and will contribute to the further improvement of proactive transparency. The planned redesign of the website and its modernization are needed in order to make the existing contents, information and data more accessible to all stakeholders who use them for the sake of being informed, but also due to the needs of performing their business activities, as well as the need for citizens to be more easily informed about the results of the work of the National Assembly. Moreover, a redesign is necessary in order to introduce new types of contents, information and data to the website of the National Assembly. Finally, it will enable the National Assembly Service to continue its proactive approach to publishing contents arising from its work and the work of the National Assembly.

Commitment Analysis

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? By implementing the proposed solution, i.e. by redesigning the website of the National Assembly, introducing new contents and new publication formats (when possible), all stakeholders will have significantly easier access to information about the work of the National Assembly, as well as about the work of other state authorities, organizations and bodies. 

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? Starting from the fact that the recommendation will enable easier and simpler access to information, it will also indirectly improve the level of accountability concerning the available contents, which will thus be more visible and easier to follow. 

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? Indirectly, and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia, the Law on the National Assembly and the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly, which refer to the publicity of work, the recommendation will also contribute to the improvement of citizens' participation in decision- making, given that adequate, accessible and timely information is the main prerequisite of civic participation.

SL0028,Sierra Leone,3,7,SLE,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2019,2021,2,NA,Open Parliament,Open Parliament,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address?
The Government of Sierra Leone has demonstrated
a strong desire to implement Open Government
Partnership (OGP) Commitments, as demonstrated
through the National Council for Civic Education and
Development identifying and adopting OGP as a
strategic pillar. Yet the Sierra Leone Parliament is
not playing a key role within the OGP process. It is
assumed that without Parliament’s commitment and
support in the process it will be challenging for many
of the OGP commitments to be fully implemented
and there will continue to be challenges in achieving
the Sustainable Development Goals. For instance,
Parliament currently has very limited platforms to
engage with citizens and CSOs and the Parliament
is yet to provide annual reports on their operations to
demonstrate leadership in accountability and
transparency as regards lawmaking processes,
oversight, and representation.

What is the commitment?
The commitment entails action that will enable
Parliament to become more open and transparent
to its citizens and effectively collaborate with other
actors in dispensing its functions as enshrined in
the Constitution of Sierra Leone.
Outcome 1: More open, responsive democratic
institution with increased civil society’s
engagement, the following are expected progress
markers:
- Parliament working group commits to
conduct oversight on the implementation of
the National Action Plan
- Parliament implement and monitor the
developed mechanisms for citizens’
participation in the legislative and budgeting
process.
- Parliament to produce annual reports on all
its activities in an accessible formats
(including special needs group) and publish
in the parliamentary website.
- Parliament to hold consultations and
hearings with civil society organizations on the budgeting process, implementation,
critical public policy issues and the Auditor
General’s Report for constructive inputs and
feedback.
Outcome 2: Greater access and inclusion of
women and marginalized groups and informal
political participation, the following are expected
progress markers:
- Develop a Gender and Equity Compliance
Checklist that will be utilized by Government
functionaries including political parties.
- Percentage increase in women and members
of marginalized groups contesting for
leadership positions in formal political
institutions in Sierra Leone
- Parliament to assess budgeting allocation
and approval based on the submission of
Gender and Equity Compliance Certificate to
ascertain that such body meets the
benchmarks set justifying the level of
accessibility and benefit received by
marginalized groups through government
programmes.How will the commitment
contribute to solving the
public problem
Three key approaches will be utilised in the
implementation of this programme and these are:
1. Capacity building of critical Committees
(Transparency and Accountability, Public
Accounts, Finance Committee, Legislative
and Education Committees) that will
establish Parliament’s leadership in OGP
and capacitating MPs and ‘OGP Working
Group’ as ‘champion’ in applying the OGP
principles in the delivery of their work.
2. Supporting inclusive mechanisms in
Parliament using an integrated approach
(we will be utilizing variety of resources for
different interventions as a way of inspiring
growth and positive output).
3. Building a network of marginalised
groups promoting OGP in local
communities and linking the work of
marginalized groups to Parliament which
includes women and the disability
community.

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?
If the Sierra Leone Parliament embraces the OGP
principles in an inclusive way – through working in
alignment at both the national and community levels
with women, youths and other politically
marginalized groups - OGP can be used as a tool to
aid the Sierra Leone Parliament to carry out its
legislative, oversight and representative roles to
ensure better service delivery and enhanced
representation, accountability and transparency.
Additional Information An ad hoc Parliamentary committee, the OGP
Parliamentary Working Group, has been set as a
permanent committee to champion open
government issues in all Parliamentary proceedings
going forward. In addition, Parliament has
partnered with the National Council for Civic
Education and Development to undertake
constituency town hall meetings so as to keep
constituents abreast of proceedings in Parliament.

Parliament currently has very limited platforms to engage with citizens and CSOs. Also, several studies authored and published by CSO partners have raised concerns about Parliament’s transparency and accountability strides even when Parliament has improved largely on those areas as scored in the implementation of the Open Parliament Commitment in NAP III. Additionally, since Sierra Leone became a member of the Open Government Partnership in 2013, there have been several commitments that have to do with enactment and amendments of Laws. But most of these commitments were not fully implemented due to the fact that Parliament was not part of the process. Without Parliament’s commitment and support in the process it will be challenging for many of the OGP commitments to be fully implemented and there will continue to be challenges. However, the leadership of Parliament has in a Consultative meeting engaged CSOs and come up with what is known as a Parliamentary CSO framework that defines how both parties can work with each other in supportive manner. 

What is the commitment? This commitment is about building better relationship between CSO and Parliament. It also further gets CSOs to be less confrontational and more collaborative. It will also further create awareness among citizens the roles of Parliament and create a feedback mechanism for citizens to effectively participate in the work of Parliament. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? By building a stronger relationship, an avenue for dialogue and collaboration between Parliament and CSO. Increase in awareness on the Parliamentary Agenda among citizens It also makes Parliament accountable to citizens through publishing of its annual report 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? This commitment is relevant to the OGP values of citizen participation and transparency Sierra Leone Parliament appetites to embrace the OGP principles in an inclusive way. This period will promote Parliament’s interaction with the CSO community to increase citizens’ involvement in its legislative, oversight and representation work. This position communities and other vulnerable groups to contribute through their local social structures. OGP has gained recognition as a model that creates an enabling environment to carry out its functions in overseeing service delivery and enhanced representation, accountability, and transparency. 

Additional information In 2019, through the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, an Open Parliament commitment was proposed and later incorporated in to the third action plan.

SL0035,Sierra Leone,5,2,SLE,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2024,2028,4,NA,Open Parliament,Comprehensive Open Parliament Initiative,"Brief Description of the commitment 

This commitment encompasses a comprehensive set of initiatives to enhance transparency, accountability, and citizen engagement in parliamentary governance in Sierra Leone. Key components include the development and launch of an online Legislative Transparency Portal, establishment of a Citizen Feedback Mechanism, implementation of measures to promote enhanced budget transparency, launch of open data initiatives, strengthening of oversight mechanisms through training programs, introduction of mechanisms for public consultation on legislation, capacity building for parliamentary staff, organization of open parliament workshops and awareness campaigns, integrity and ethics training for parliamentarians, and the development of a robust monitoring and evaluation framework to assess the impact of Open Government Partnership (OGP) action plans, collectively striving towards a more open, accountable, and participatory democratic system.

Problem definition 

What problem does the commitment aim to address? Firstly, the lack of transparency and accessibility in the legislative process hinders citizens' ability to engage meaningfully with their government and hold elected officials accountable. For example, with easy access to legislative information such as bills, debates, and voting records, citizens may be able to understand the decisions being made on their behalf. Additionally, limited avenues for public feedback on proposed legislation result in a lack of citizen input in decision-making processes, leading to policies that may not fully align with the needs and expectations of the public. Secondly, insufficient oversight mechanisms and capacity gaps among parliamentary staff contribute to ineffectiveness and potential corruption within the government. Without robust oversight mechanisms and capacity, there is limited scrutiny, leading to the potential risk of mismanagement of public funds and resources. Furthermore, the absence of integrity and ethics training for parliamentarians leaves room for unethical behavior and undermines public trust in the government. Therefore, the milestones aim to address these public problems by promoting transparency, accountability, and citizen engagement in parliamentary governance, ultimately striving to create a more open, accountable, and participatory democratic system in Sierra Leone. 

What are the causes of the problem? The root cause of the problem regarding the lack of transparency and accessibility in legislative processes lies in the outdated systems for disseminating legislative information. These systems are not equipped to efficiently publish and make data accessible, possibly due to limited resources or technical capabilities stemming from a limited investment and utilization of existing ICT infrastructure. The need for more investment is hindered by prioritizing resources towards other sectors or projects, which may result from competing priorities or insufficient awareness of the importance of legislative transparency. Similarly, the limited availability of public feedback mechanisms can be traced back to the absence of effective channels for citizen engagement and feedback on proposed legislation. This absence is rooted in the need for established platforms or processes, possibly due to bureaucratic barriers or resistance to change stemming from a lack of understanding or appreciation of the importance of citizen input in decision-making. These resistances may be entrenched due to historical factors, power structures, or the absence of accountability mechanisms, resulting in limited avenues for citizen participation. Furthermore, the problem of insufficient oversight mechanisms and capacity gaps within the parliamentary system can be attributed to a lack of investment and commitment to implementing reforms. Furthermore, limited political will and vested party interest in Parliament may stem from competing priorities or systemic inertia within the parliamentary system.

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? Several efforts have been put into implementing NAP 4 by creating critical structures that will contribute to achieving full-scale openness, transparency, and accountability status in the legislative work of the Parliament of Sierra Leone. NAP 4 on Open Parliament has implemented critical commitments that resulted in having an established office space for civil society in the precinct of Parliament and a functional network that puts both CSO and Members of Parliament in a platform to discuss civic participation and inclusion in the work of the Parliament—the updated service charter and installation of a lift to make Parliament more friendly. The success of this stride cannot be over-emphasized as it has served as a lobbying network to address critical legislative gaps with the work of Parliament and its citizens. 

2. What solution are you proposing? A comprehensive solution is required to address the problem of lack of transparency, accessibility, and oversight mechanisms in the legislative process in Sierra Leone. This solution will focus on implementing robust measures to enhance transparency in the legislative process, such as developing and launching an online portal for easy access to legislative information, including bills, debates, and voting records. Also, establishing effective citizen feedback mechanisms and public consultation processes will ensure that citizen voices are heard and considered in decision-making. Furthermore, strengthening oversight mechanisms and providing integrity and ethics training for parliamentarians and staff are essential to prevent inefficiencies, corruption, and unethical behavior within the government. By promoting transparency, accountability, and citizen engagement in parliamentary governance, this solution aims to foster a more open, accountable, and participatory democratic system in Sierra Leone. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? Implementing this commitment aims to achieve several key results, including increased transparency, citizen engagement, and accountability in parliamentary governance. The desired outputs encompass developing and launching online portals for legislative information, establishing citizen feedback mechanisms, implementing measures to enhance budget transparency, and launching open data initiatives for parliamentary data accessibility. Furthermore, the commitment seeks to strengthen oversight mechanisms through training programs for parliamentarians and staff, introduce public consultation mechanisms on legislation, conduct capacity-building programs for parliamentary staff, and organize workshops and awareness campaigns on parliamentary processes and civic engagement. Ultimately, these initiatives aim to foster a more informed and participatory democratic system where citizens are empowered to contribute meaningfully to policymaking processes. Changes in knowledge, skills, and capacities are anticipated among citizens, parliamentarians, and staff, leading to improved understanding of legislative processes, enhanced oversight skills, and increased awareness of ethical conduct and integrity. These efforts are expected to change behavior, systems, and practices, including greater transparency, accountability, and citizen participation in parliamentary governance, promoting a more inclusive and effective democratic system in Sierra Leone.

Commitment Description
What is the public problem that the commitment will address?
In democracy, the involvement of the citizens in the political process is essential. Ideally, when citizens participate, they themselves must assess their own needs and inform the local government what these needs are, may it be through an online or offline public channel. The same must also go with the legislation process. Despite the gains realized in reducing poverty incidence, 19.8% of families remain poor in 2015. The nature and quality of local policies and legislation greatly influence and shape the process and outcomes of local development administration. Hence, for governance to be effective in reducing poverty, only relevant ordinances and policies that can effectively alleviate poverty based on the outputs of intensified engagement with the general public must be enacted and implemented. Currently, involvement of citizens to provide input on proposed legislative measures as well as to propose possible new legislative measures that matter to them is limited since the constituents have limited knowledge on passed and proposed legislative measures especially that public hearing is not mandatory for all legislative measures. For legislative measures that require public consultations, only a small percentage of the local population is reached due to limitations of funds in sending communications and conducting face-to-face (offline) assemblies and gatherings. There is a lack of understanding and awareness among the general public that they can actually be involved in the formulation of local policies and ordinances, and on how to access existing policies/ordinances. Further, records of existing legislations (resolutions and ordinances) are also not readily accessible and available both offline and online. All these lead to majority of people not actively participating in the decisionmaking process during legislation. While those who are aware of their right to participate or access legislative information lose interest since the process is not clear on how to voice out essential opinions.
What is the commitment?
The commitment aims to create more space for citizen engagement in order to improve the local legislative process through online channels, hence, increase the relevance of local legislation in addressing the people’s felt needs and perceived development issues. This can be done by first establishing an automated database for legislations – Legislative Information Technology System (LITS) - that would serve as the central database for all current and ongoing legislations that can be easily accessed. Information on the status of ongoing legislations will also be viewed through the system. The Sangguniang Panlalawigan Office will set-up a computer where researchers and the general public may search, query and access records on existing and on-going legislations. The LITS will serve as a database for legislative records where people can readily search current and on-going/pending policies and ordinances. This legislative database will also be linked to the Provincial Online Database so that this can be accessed by the public anytime online. Online platforms also include setting-up of an official Facebook page for the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of South Cotabato and linking this to South Cotabato’s official website and Facebook page where anyone can suggest new policies and ordinances as well as give comments on current or existing policies and ordinances. This will be the platform for the general public to be consulted and propose ideas on new legislations, and provide feedback both on existing and proposed local policies and ordinances that will truly make a difference to their lives. This is in addition to the face-to-face public consultations being currently conducted for legislations that require public consultation.
How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem?
Establishing both online media/channels to disseminate and consult citizens on legislative processes and measures will further broaden citizen engagement in legislation and ensure the passing and implementation of relevant pieces of legislation that will be truly effective in responding to the real issues and development problems of communities.
Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?
Increase transparency and citizen participation by providing more avenue/platform for citizens to access relevant information on local legislative processes and measures.  Leveraging technology for better governance by establishing online mechanisms and digital information systems to open legislative processes. Promote inclusion and gender-sensitivity by tagging enacted legislations that are authored by women or those that primarily benefit women. 
Additional information
The commitment under open legislation will be implemented in partnership with a local CSO, Mahintana Foundation, Inc. (MFI), as lead partner. MFI has already developed an automated system for the legislative records and processes of the Office of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan but would only need to enhance it in order to make the system more open and accessible online by linking it to the Provincial Online Database. As relevant policies and legislation provide the environment for equitable and inclusive growth to prosper, this commitment will significantly contribute to the realization of all the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly on goals 1 (No Poverty) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

Experience to date suggests that the process of consultation, and of formal pre-legislative scrutiny by parliamentary committees, has potential to improve the quality of legislation by engaging stakeholders and the wider public at an early stage, giving an opportunity for legislation to reflect the input of those potentially affected by it. Making this practice the norm will, given the experience to date, help further the transparency of law and the policy development process, and improve understanding and engagement with legislation. Government is committed to following Principle 2.4 of the Compact which states, “Give early notice of forthcoming consultations, where possible, allowing enough time for civil society organisations to involve their service users, beneficiaries, members, volunteers and trustees in preparing responses. Where it is appropriate, and enables meaningful engagement, conduct 12-week formal written consultations, with clear explanations and a rationale for shorter timeframes or a more informal approach.”
Timescales: The procedure and timescales for publishing bills in draft is set by the Cabinet Office’s Parliamentary Business and Legislation Secretariat and Parliament. At an early stage in the process of approving work on new legislation, the government will set out its commitment to publish a bill in draft on GOV.UK (or the reasons why publication is not appropriate in a particular case). The effect of publication will be evaluated on a case by case basis. This will take into account levels of stakeholder engagement in policy development.

En el 2020 se dio comienzo en el Parlamento al programa denominado PROPACI (Programa de Participación Ciudadana). A través de este programa se desarrolló una herramienta virtual que permite a todas las personas formar parte de la labor legislativa, proponiendo nuevos proyectos de ley, sugiriendo temas a las comisiones parlamentarias y aportando mejoras a los proyectos vigentes. Actualmente se reciben las propuestas a través de la herramienta, pero no se encuentra en la plataforma información sobre quién las recibe, las respuestas brindadas y la retroalimentación de las mismas. Faltan reglas que regulen la forma en cómo se consideran las contribuciones en la toma de decisiones, y procesos que fomenten y faciliten la participación e involucramiento. El conocimiento por parte de todas las personas sobre la existencia del PROPACI y las posibilidades que ofrece para la participación es aún limitado. 

¿Cuál es el compromiso? Institucionalizar la política de Parlamento Abierto en el ámbito de la Cámara de Senadores. Reglamentar el funcionamiento del Programa de Participación Ciudadana (PROPACI) digital del Parlamento para fortalecer la implantación de la herramienta en el ámbito de la referida Cámara, y contribuir a garantizar una participación efectiva de las personas. Desarrollar acciones complementarias orientadas a impulsar la participación digital de las mujeres en el PROPACI. 

¿Cómo contribuirá a resolver la problemática? La institucionalización de un espacio a través de la creación de un área con personal dedicado, para la dirección, desarrollo e implementación de iniciativas de parlamento abierto, permitirá transversalizar y articular las acciones en materia de transparencia, acceso a la información, participación ciudadana y rendición de cuentas en el ámbito de la Cámara de Senadores y proporcionará liderazgo institucional, respaldo y sostenibilidad al proceso. La reglamentación de los procesos internos para canalizar adecuadamente los aportes e inquietudes de las personas recibidas a través del PROPACI hacia los distintos ámbitos parlamentarios y la regulación de pautas que incorporen estándares y buenas prácticas en materia de participación ciudadana, buscará mejorar la calidad de los procesos de participación instrumentados a través de esta herramienta. La adecuación de la herramienta permitirá implementar mejoras y buenas prácticas en materia de participación ciudadana habilitando el intercambio y seguimiento de las propuestas y respuestas de las y los legisladores. Atendiendo al propósito de incorporar la perspectiva de género en la iniciativa se buscará fortalecer la participación ciudadana de las mujeres, generando instancias de difusión, capacitación y fomento de uso de la herramienta orientadas a promover la participación e incidencia de las mujeres en el ámbito parlamentario. Se espera un fortalecimiento de los procesos participativos que facilite la toma de decisiones parlamentarias más inclusivas y representativas, así como la ampliación de los espacios que tiene la ciudadanía para comunicar sus intereses. 

¿Por qué es relevante a los valores de OGP? El compromiso es relevante a la participación cívica, ya que permite que las personas puedan comunicar sus intereses y buscar incidir en los procesos legislativos a través de la incorporación de nuevas herramientas. Complementariamente, contribuirá a mejorar la transparencia activa y rendición de cuentas de los procesos participativos implementados a través de la herramienta.

Actualmente el funcionamiento del plenario, las votaciones y demás procesos vinculados a la labor legislativa departamental se realiza por mecanismos tradicionales, el control de la votación de los ediles y edilas se realiza a mano alzada y exige el conteo manual para la proclamación de la votación por parte de la Presidencia del plenario. Estos controles tienen sus complejidades por tratarse de un órgano con 31 bancas en las que existe suplencia automática, en una misma sesión y donde podrían teóricamente interactuar hasta 124 ediles considerando que cada titular tiene tres suplentes. El funcionamiento tradicional de la junta complejiza facilitar el acceso a la información pública hacia la ciudadanía. 

¿Cuál es el compromiso? Desarrollar una estrategia de transformación digital de la Junta Departamental de Maldonado que fortalezca la transparencia y rendición de cuentas sobre la labor legislativa departamental incorporando un sistema de voto electrónico para los ediles y edilas, que habilite el control de asistencia a las sesiones plenarias y comisiones, la verificación de la correcta conformación del plenario y el control del cuórum. 

¿Cómo contribuirá a resolver la problemática? Contar con una estrategia de transformación digital que integre las herramientas tecnológicas, los procesos y las personas para generar un cambio cultural en la Junta Departamental de Maldonado, transversalizando los valores de gobierno abierto en su funcionamiento. Generar las adaptaciones reglamentarias para institucionalizar esta transformación y garantizar su aplicación. La iniciativa integrará la utilización de la cédula de identidad electrónica como instrumento para fortalecer el control de asistencia al plenario, conformación, el control del cuórum y la votación del edil desde su banca hasta la proclamación de la votación. Asimismo se abordará un plan de sensibilización y capacitación, orientado al funcionariado y a la ciudadanía que permita la implantación efectiva a nivel institucional y el aprovechamiento por parte de la ciudadanía. 

¿Por qué es relevante a los valores de OGP? Se impulsa la innovación tecnológica para impulsar los pilares de gobierno abierto, en el funcionamiento de la Junta Departamental de Maldonado, incrementando la transparencia y rendición de cuentas en la labor legislativa en los gobiernos departamentales, como práctica de buen gobierno y como elemento indispensable para habilitar una mayor participación ciudadana. La iniciativa puede considerarse como una experiencia piloto experiencia piloto con potencialidad de ser replicada en otras juntas departamentales del país, dado que utilizará software libre en el desarrollo del nuevo sistema y se prevé la disponibilización del código para que pueda reutilizarse.

This law serves at increasing transparency of public and private institutions by creating a better environment for employees to step up and denounce corruption cases. The law defines corruption related offences, delineates the competences of the internal mechanisms, and pinpoints which body should serve as the external reporting mechanisms and defines how the protection of whistleblowers should be ensured. In addition, the law applies both to the public and private sector. It was adopted in Parliament on June 2, 2016. By Decree of the President of the Republic No.9647 dated on 20.06.2016, the law was published in the Official Gazette No.115 on June 23, 2016 and it entered into force on July 8, 2016. Its legal effects extend from October 1, 2016 with the exception of legal effects for internal whistleblowing for private subjects, which start on July 1, 2017 (Note: this was a commitment of NAP 2nd 2014-2016). Objectives for this NAP’s commitment: - Drafting of bylaws, relevant instructions and reporting forms for the prosecution and investigation by HIDAACI for successful implementation of this law; - Consultations with stakeholders in Tirana and other districts for the introduction of bylaws, consultation and recommendations thereof; - Capacity building through trainings and technical assistance for staff of HIDAACI and other public administration staff about the successful implementation of the law, bylaws and regulations, preparation of job descriptions for staff responsible for receiving alerts and pursuits; - Awareness and education campaigns in the media of the law and the importance of its implementation in the fight against corruption. Status quo or problem addressed by the commitment The 2 year process of drafting the Law “On protection of whistleblowers”, as an important preventive tool and reporting of corrupt practices within the public authorities and private entities, has come to an end. The draft law was approved by the Council of Ministers on December 16, 2015; On February 17, 2016, the bill was introduced by Minister Çuçi at the Parliamentary Commission for Legal Issues, Public Administration and Human Rights, where discussions were held first in principle on the content of the draft law among the members of the Commission (rapporteur: V. Hysi) and representatives from the Ministry of Local Affairs. On March 1, 2016, the draft was discussed in principle in the Parliamentary Commission of National Security and was approved in principle. On March 7, 2016, the Parliamentary Committee for Legal Issues, Public Administration and Human Rights, in accordance with the Rules of Parliament, held a hearing with representatives of independent institutions, civil society organizations and international organizations to review the draft law ""On protection of whistleblowers"" (rapporteur: V. Hysi). Independent institutions that have participated directly in the Commission were: General Prosecutor, the Ombudsman, HIDAACI and Commissioner for Protection against Discrimination, and civil society representatives also took part, the Albanian Helsinki Committee, Institute for Democracy and Mediation, the Albanian Institute of Science, Partners Albania and Flag. However, comments on the draft came also from OSCE, EUD, etc. MLA, in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice as co proposers of the bill, have considered comments received from all stakeholders and reflected them in the draft. On 29 and 30 March 2016, the bill was approved in principle and article by article in the Parliamentary Commission for Legal Issues, Public Administration and Human Rights. The draft law was approved by the Parliament and comes into force in October 2016. In the forcoming, it is also expected: (i) issuance of bylaws; (Ii) strengthen capacities of HIDAACI with 7-8 people that will implement the bill. Drafting of this bill has become part of the fulfillment of the Roadmap for the five priorities recommended by the European Commission, approved by Council of Ministers Decision No. 330, dated 28.05.2014 and in fulfillment of the Crosscutting Anti Corruption Strategy for 2015-2020, approved by the Council of Ministers Decision No. 247, dated 20.03.2015. This law stipulates creation of a new mechanism of denunciation of corruption practices in the workplace by employees of a public authority or private entity in the Republic of Albania. There are some several key factors that will influence the governance of public and private institutions, increase transparency for the public and discourage corruptive practices as a result of the adoption of this law: (i) encouraging the public to actively use mechanisms of reporting and preventive corruption in the workplace; (Ii) increase transparency in public administration activities and private enterprises; (Ii) encourage cooperation with the institutions of justice; and (iii) protection of whistleblowers against retaliatory measures.

AL0066,Albania,5,2,ALB,Europe,National,1,2020,2022,2,Open Government in the Fight against Corruption,Beneficial Ownership Register,Creation of online beneficial ownership register,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? A beneficial owner is the real person or real people who own, control or benefit from a legal entity, such as a company or organization. Criminals can use an ‘anonymous owner’ or a ‘nominee’ as owner of a company in order to secretly move, launder and spend money from criminal activity. Often these secret companies are used to pay or receive bribes or engage in other corrupt practices or to avoid taxes. When open registries require legal entities to disclose the individuals who own or control the legal entity, through direct ownership or indirect ownership through shares for example, money is more easily traceable. Therefore, it becomes more difficult to use legal entities to hide the profits from corruption and crime and therefore, reduces the attractiveness and ease of engaging in such criminal activity. In Albania only the Law no. 9917/2008 ‘‘On the prevention of money launderingand terrorist financing’’ has included explicit mention of beneficial ownership. The legal entities under the jurisdiction of this law are obligated to identify the beneficial owners of their customers; however, this data has not been recorded in a designated national register. Furthermore, under current legislation legal entities registered in the Republic of Albania are not obligated to identify and register data on their beneficial owners in a designated national register.Thus, there has lacked the legal framework necessary to require by law the disclosure and register of beneficial owners of legal entities. Furthermore, without the adequate establishment of procedures and manner of registration and storage of the beneficial ownership data or the punitive measures for non-registration of beneficial ownership, criminal activity and corrupt practices can more easily be hidden. 

What is the commitment? This commitment outlines the pathway to establishing a functioning central register of beneficial owners in order to reduce the opportunities for hiding corruption and criminal activity and its profits. Through the development, approval and implementation of the law “On the Register of Beneficial Owners” (the UBO Law) and by-laws that explicitly define beneficial ownership, outline the requirements of legal entities to report to the register and the rules and procedures for the register itself the commitment establishes the legislative basis necessary for an effective beneficial ownership register. The implementation of the register of beneficial owners will consist of an electronic database held by the National Business Center (NBC). All legal entities required to report and register their beneficial owner information will be obliged to submit information regarding their beneficial owners as outlines by the UBO Law or face financial sanctions for non- Commitments | Open Government in the Fight against Corruption |Commitment 2 compliance.Thus, through this initiative, transparency regarding the real ownership and control of legal entities will be promoted and provided, as well as more data to which the public may have access. Objective: The drafting of the law “On the Register of Beneficial Owners” and the accompanying by-laws through a consultative process with stakeholders aim to establish the manner and procedures of data registration for beneficial ownership that accounts for the technical and operational challenges of identifying beneficial owners in Albania. The implementation of the register through this framework aims to establish a system that promotes transparency, due diligence and ethical practices and severely reduces the opportunities for money laundering, bribery, tax evasion and other forms of corruption. Expected results: • Approval of the draft law ‘Register of Beneficial Ownership’; • Drafting and approval of the bylaws: -“On determining the manner and procedures of data registration for beneficial ownership, as well as the notification from the competent state authorities and from the obligated subjects”; -“On determining the rules for the functioning of the Register of Beneficial Ownership, on the way of communication in electronic form and exchange of data between the National Business Center and responsible state bodies, as well as for the manner and terms of communication between the Register of Beneficial Ownership, the Trade Register and the Register of Non-Profit Organizations” • Implementation of the Law on the Register of Beneficial Ownership; • Creation of the Register of Beneficial Ownership by the end of 2021. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? In order to meet the 'Beneficiary Ownership' objective, MoFE efforts have focused on adapting the necessary legal basis. The Law no. 112/2020 ""On the register of beneficial ownership""(milestone 1), fulfils one of the recommendations of MONEYVAL. The law partially approximates Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council, dated 20 May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Directive 2006/70/EC.This law regulates the definition of the beneficial ownership; the obligated entities which must register the beneficial owners; the creation, functioning and administration of the Register of Beneficiary Ownership; the procedure and the manner of registration and storage of the registered data of the beneficial ownership as well as the punitive measures in case of non-registration of the beneficial ownership. More specifically, this law applies to the reporting entities, legal entities registered in the Republic of Albania according to the provisions set in the law. The register will be set up and managed by the National Business Center and will be accessed only by the persons authorized to represent the reporting entity and bythe competent state authorities. Any person wishing to obtain information from the register that is not freely accessible and public can only do so if they are able to prove that they have a legitimate legal interest in obtaining this information. Another task derived by legislative base adaption is the drafting of bylaws, which will be realized with the financial and technical assistance of GIZ, specifically: the DCM “On determining the manner and procedures of data registration for beneficial ownership, as well as the notification from the competent state authorities and from the obligated subjects” (milestone 2) and the DCM “On determining the rules for the functioning of the Register of Beneficial Ownership, on the way of communication in electronic form and exchange of data between the National Business Center and responsible state bodies, as well as for the manner and terms of communication between the Register of Beneficiary Owners, the Trade Register and the Register of Non-Profit Organizations” (milestone: 3) , are in the drafting process. Finally, the Ministry of Finance and Economy and the National Agency for the Information Society must establish the Register of Beneficial Ownership until 2021 (milestone 4).

AL0072,Albania,5,8,ALB,Europe,National,1,2020,2022,2,"Fiscal Transparency to improve the coverage, quality and accessibility of information on public finances.",Budget Transparency,Publish accessible budget information online for citizen engagement,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Transparency, public participation, and legislative oversight in the development of budgets creates better outcomes and are the main issues to better improve the citizen access on fiscal documents.Increasing accountability over the budget and fiscal cycle deters waste and corruption and ensures that budgetary decisions and spending reflect the people’s interests. Through transparency, public participation and legislative oversight this openness can help combat corruption. Increasing transparency and public participation across the budget and fiscal cycle is particularly important for Albania. In recent years fiscal transparency has been increasing in Albania. Between 2010 and 2019 Albania’s score on the Open Budget Index6 (OBI) has increased from 33 to 55 out of a possible 100. While encouraging, according to the OBI’s 2019 assessment Albania have done progress but still does not publish enough material to support informed public debate on the budget7 . In the 2019 assessment of the online availability, timeliness, and comprehensiveness of eight key budget documents Albania ranked 43r d out of 117 countries. In order for fiscal transparency to facilitate the citizen empowerment necessary to scrutinize public finances and therefore promote public financial accountability the publication of documents alone will not be sufficient. Without increasing the accessibility of fiscal information fiscal transparency will not be effective in promoting more accountable fiscal governance. Thus, efforts towards fiscal openness in Albania will aim to facilitate increased public understanding. The OBI has recommended that Albania expand the financial and policy information in the Executive's Budget Proposal, Year-End Report, and Mid-Year Review to be more specific, disaggregating information to provide stakeholders with a more comprehensive understanding. 

What is the commitment? Budget transparency consists of publishing budget reports and relevant financial data in formats that are understandable and accessible to all citizens will help to develop the fiscal transparency necessary for citizens to be well enough informed to participate in public debate on aspects of the budget and to meaningfully engage and participate in the planning and execution of the budget. 6 The OBI measures public access to informa tion on how the central government raises and spends public resources and assesses the online availability, timeliness, and comprehensiveness of eight key budget documents 7According to the OBI a fiscal transparency score of 61/100 or higher indicates a country likely publishes adequate information for informed public debate Commitments |Fiscal Transparency | Commitment 8 Due to the technical nature of many public budget and fiscal documents in order for fiscal transparency to be achieved this commitment will establish the timely publication information in a format that is not only easily accessible online, but is also easily understood, uses plain language and includes accompanying supplementary resources or information that explain more complex or technical concepts in laments terms. Further efforts shall be made to engage the public in the budget process so as to promote public accountability to citizens through civic participation. Objective: Albania’s commitment to improving budget transparency aims to guarantee a public finance system that promotes transparency, accountability, fiscal discipline and efficiency in the management and use of public resources to improve the quality of service delivery and economic development. The commitment aims to achieve enhanced accountability and transparency through better financial and non-financial performance reporting in line with international standards to improve coverage, quality and accessibility of information on public finances and promote civic engagement throughout the budget cycle. Expected results: • A sustainable statistical system for the general government units is in place; • Timely and reliable government financial statistics; • Published in year and annual financial reports contain accessible financial and non-financial performance information; • Strengthened financial oversight and management of the fiscal risks; • Formal opportunities provided for the public to engage in the planning and execution of the budget; • More structured and timely engagement with citizens, civil society organizations and academia in budget planning, monitoring and reporting. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? To establish increased budget transparency this commitment will prioritize alignment with international methodologies for statistical information, strengthening the sale, scope, timeliness and accessibility of the information published and create opportunities for citizens to engage in the budget process. The timely publication of government national accounts in accordance with the European System of Accounts (ESA) 2010 and using a revised statistical system (milestone 1) aims to ensure the reliability of published government accounts and provide a framework for efficient and accurate complication and publication of financial statistics that aligns with international best practices. To promote public financial oversight and accountability an improved fiscal risk statement will be developed in order to better monitor and mitigate any financial risks (milestone 2). Increasing fiscal transparency requires that the information available be relevant and timely. As such, budget execution and financial annual (milestone 3) and mid-year (milestone 4) reports will be published in year. They will include plain language and supplementary non-financial performance information to be easily accessible to citizens and promote comprehensive of budget related information and reports. Finally a budget hearing calendar for key budget processes will enable (milestone 5).

AL0081,Albania,6,8,ALB,Europe,National,1,2023,2025,2,Promotion of Digital Transformation and Innovation,Transposition of the EU web accessibility directive for government portals (Web Accessibility Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2016 on the accessibility of websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies”),Transposition of EU Directive for Web Accessibility,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

According to Decision of The Council of Ministers No. 276, dated 12.5.2021, ""On the approval of the National Plan for Persons with Disabilities, 2021-2025,"" the National Agency of Information Society has begun a collaboration process with the Ministry of Health and Social Protection regarding the redesign of public institution websites to make them accessible to persons with disabilities. Currently, some technical improvements have been made to the ministries' websites, allowing those with limited capabilities to access them more easily. The measures envisioned in the National Plan for Persons with Disabilities, 2021-2025, are more broadly related to improvements in the legal framework as well as technical improvements, such as the development/adaptation of standards for ensuring Internet accessibility, to ensure that persons with limited abilities have equal access to public sector websites, services, applications, and their content. Following that, technological implementations in e-albania will be carried out to adapt the portal to all the features of the demands for individuals with the capacity to assure equitable access. Since 2019, all official websites of the ministries have special functionalities dedicated to people with disabilities to facilitate access to information on services provided by public institutions such as: 1. Zoom (Helps the category of people who have limited visibility) 2. Contrast (Helps the category of dyslexic persons) 3. TAB navigation (Helps the category of paraplegics). Moreover, the e-Albania governmental portal enables every citizen to apply online for 1227 public services and often complete their online service or withdraw documents bearing full legal value without the need to leave their home. These are just the first steps, but promising, for inclusion and accessibility of everyone to public information and public services.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? The e-Albania platform offers more than 1227online services, as we have previously reported. This implies that The e-Albania platform handles 95% of all requests for public services. The e-Albania portal offers excellent and quick electronic services for people and businesses, allowing citizens to just remember one portal connection when looking for public services online. To aid the populace and offer services to everyone, there is always room for development and the introduction of new ideas. Through this, we hope to communicate our goals for: Increasing the e-Albania platform's electronic services' accessibility to people with disabilities. The actions planned in the National Plan for Persons with Disabilities are more clearly relevant to legal framework improvements as well as technical improvements, such as the development/adaptation of standards for guaranteeing Internet accessibility, to make sure that persons with limited abilities have equal access to public sector websites, services, applications, and their content. Following that, technical implementations in e-albania will be implemented in order to adapt the portal to all of the needs for persons with the ability to provide equal access. 

3. What are the causes of the problem? Since e-Albania is the main portal that offers public services to anyone at any time,It is our responsibility to complete this task and leave no one behind. It is necessary to make services and the platform accessible to everyone, including those who have limited abilities. 

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? The National Agency for Information Society is partnering with institutions for individuals with disabilities to make this pledge a reality in the near future.The process of designing and implementing functionalities and standards that will facilitate access for persons with disabilities has begun within the framework of improving the standards for web accessibility of government websites, as well as for the government platform e-Albania and its electronic services, supporting and aiding in their independence, employment participation, mobility, technology, and communication. Specifically, the Action Plan is: - Adaption of international standards to provide ICT access in government portals and counters. - Taking measures so that public equipment and services are accessible to people with visual impairments, hearing problems, mobility difficulties, as well as people with intellectual disabilities using: a) universal symbol; b) programs that allow persons with visual impairments to read; c) sound equipment; d) provide apps that allow users with visual issues to enlarge text and icon size; e) be equipped with Braille code readers and printers (in a reasonable number). - Implementation of accessibility standards on the portal https://e-albania.al and all other public interactive portals. A special emphasis will be placed on emergency/emergency communications. 

2. What solution are you proposing? Transposition of the EU web accessibility directive for government portals. Supporting the implementation of the Directive, to facilitate cooperation between Members and stakeholders and to exchange best practices in the field of web accessibility. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? Following letter No. 244 Prot., dated 30.09.2021, with the subject ""Cooperation for standards in increasing accessibility"" from the Institute of Blind Students, which has expressed its willingness to be involved in this process, as well as based on the Council's Decision of Ministers No. 673 dated 22.11.2017, ""On the reorganization of the National Agency of the Information Society"" as amended, and VKM no. 276, dated 12.5.2021 ""On the approval of the National Plan for Persons with Disabilities, 2021-2025"", we proceed as follows: In the framework of improving the standards for web accessibility of government websites as well as for the government platform e-Albania and its electronic services, it is necessary to start the process for the design and implementation of functionalities and standards which will facilitate access for persons with disabilities, thus promoting and assisting in their independence, inclusion in employment, movement, technology and communication

The Government of Albania is committed to gradual introduction of a modern system of public sector accounting based on international standards. Public accounting in Albania is currently done on a cash basis with elements of accruals with regard to assets and liabilities. This initiative aims to enhance the quality of public sector accounting and financial reporting in the Republic of Albania, considering the clear need for reforming financial reporting across Albania. This reform includes: a) Development of public sector accounting and financial reporting in line with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS); b) Development of Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE) capacities and of professional accounting skills for public accounting practitioners. Increase awareness of Line Ministries and Local Government Units regarding Asset Management

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? Municipalities are the government tier closest to citizens and as such are potentially able to address the needs of their communities better than the central government. Considering the information advantage of the municipalities over the central government, they can potentially better tailor the offer of public goods and services to the citizens needs and preferences. Decentralization reforms undertaken in Albania between 2015 and 2018 aimed at strengthening local government, through the development of conditions and capacities to provide quality and efficient local services. The tax on immovable properties and transactions on them is a considerable and sustained source of revenue for the local budget. Even though revenue collected over the years from the tax on immovable properties has generally had a growing trend, issues related to property rights and the lack of a fiscal cadaster, among other things, do not allow the potential of this tax to be fully achieved. Following the full reforming of this tax as by Law No. 106/2017 “On some changes and additions to Law No. 9632, dated 30.10.2006 “On the local taxes system”, as amended, based on the media communications of the Ministry of Finance and Economy, all municipalities were expected to apply the tax on immovable properties based on the new methodology in 2019. Currently, not every municipality has undertaken this step, because of issues with the collection of the required data to apply this methodology. In structural terms, revenue from the building tax makes up the largest share of the total revenue from taxes on immovable properties. Our main objective is to assist the General Directorate of Property Tax during the training sessions with the staff of Municipalities as well as raising awareness to the community on the importance of collecting property tax for the local units. The Government of Albania is committed to gradual introduction of a modern system of public sector accounting based on international standards. Public accounting in Albania is currently done on a cash basis with elements of accruals with regard to assets and liabilities. This initiative aims to enhance the quality of public sector accounting and financial reporting in the Republic of Albania, considering the clear need for reforming financial reporting across Albania. This reform includes: a) Development of public sector accounting and financial reporting in line with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS); b) Development of Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE) capacities and of professional accounting skills for public accounting practitioners. This commitment is supported by a World Bank project, which has the objective of the development of a road map for public sector accrual accounting implementation and to support the early stages of this reform, including building essential technical skills. Aligned to the Albania PFM strategy (2019-2022), the main objectives of the project are as follows: a) Development of national guide, institutional arrangements and long term action plan for transition from the existing public sector accounting and financial reporting framework, in alignment with the development of treasury system (AGFIS) into AFMIS. b) Presentation of financial statements in accordance with selected IPSAS standard. c) Improvement quality of accounting, statistical and financial reporting evidenced by the PEFA assessment. d) Improved technical capacity of the Financial Reporting Unit of the MoFE. e) Public Accounting rules implementation and Central Harmonization Unit (in charge of Public Accounting methodology) in improving the quality of the public sector financial reporting. f) Development of a sustainable public sector accounting qualification compatible with international good practices; and improved understanding and application of relevant accounting standards by practitioners and public sector auditors. 

2. What are the causes of the problem? The main purpose of this commitment is because of the existence of some problems, identified during the gap analysis such as: • Lack of precise determination of the number of controlled public sector units; • The legal framework for public sector accounting and financial reporting was complex, fragmented and unclear; • Lack of vocational education and training in the field of public sector finance and accounting; • Lack of a code of ethics for public sector accountants; • Confusing budget system; • Partial functioning of the AGFIS system (Government Financial Information System), despite being used in most of the public sector; Lack of a consolidated asset register for the General Government Units in Albania (lack of a certain methodology for measurement and inventory of assets). 

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? During these years, we have carried out activities as follow: • Revision of the business processes that would enable reporting under IPSAS; • Revision of Chart of Accounts; • Assessment of AGFIS Functionality to Handle Accounting and Reporting under IPSAS Accrual Basis of Accounting; • Instruction on Opening Balances. • Preparation of accrual accounting instructions regarding: ✓ Inventory ✓ Accruals and expense ✓ Provisions ✓ Intangible Assets ✓ Employee benefits ✓ Property, Plant and Equipment ✓ Revenue ✓ Financial instruments ✓ Reporting and Presentation ✓ Consolidation • Train the trainers program on public sector financial reporting and accounting based on IPSAS (28 participants). • Pilot the first-time training of the finance and accounting staff in central government institutions on public sector accounting and financial reporting based in IPSAS.(100 accountants from about 20 different institutions). • Training of the finance and accounting staff on public sector accounting and financial reporting based in IPSAS (400 accountants). 2. What solution are you proposing? Public accounting in Albania is currently done on a cash basis with elements of accruals regarding assets and liabilities. In this regard, we will follow partial adoption of IPSAS. Partial adoption of IPSAS: National public sector GAAP is modified and/or new public sector GAAP is issued that is consistent with selected parts of selected IPSAS. There are many reasons why this is the preferred approach, including: 1. There is a list with consistencies and inconsistencies between Albanian public sector GAAP and IPSAS for each standard. Also, not all the IPSAS standards are relevant for the Albanian context and not all the parts of a standard are applicable in the Albanian context. 2. The current approach provides accountants with concrete, specific and clear accounting principles to ensure unambiguous understanding of requirements and avoid any inconsistencies in the application of the accounting standards. Some of the original IPSAS are not aligned with the local country approach and cultural expectations regarding the accounting cases. Increase awareness of Line Ministries and Local Government Units regarding Asset Management. This is important for several reasons: • Proper management of assets can help institutions make informed decisions about the allocation of resources, improve the accuracy of financial reporting, and reduce the risk of fraud and errors. • Proper asset management practices can help budget institutions comply with regulations and standards related to financial reporting, asset valuation, and asset disposal. • Effective asset management can help institutions prioritize investments in infrastructure, extend the life of existing assets, and plan for the replacement of assets at the end of their useful life. • Sound asset management practices can increase transparency and accountability in budget institutions. This can help stakeholders understand how the institution is using its assets and resources, and ensure that public funds are being used effectively and efficiently. 3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? • Greater transparency and accountability of the financial decisions made by jurisdictions for donors, citizens and investors; • Complete information to aid better decision making; • A complete inventory of assets and stocks, which enables entities to assess whether these are being used effectively, efficiently and economically to deliver public services; • Internationally recognized government reporting framework is an important factor in the assessment of a country’s financial stability and attractiveness for investment by supporting fairer and more accurate credit ratings and encourage foreign direct investment; • Governance of public finances will be enhanced through greater transparency and accountability required by the disclosure of government assets and in particular liabilities. • Developing awareness activities for budget institutions regarding asset management will improve financial and operational performance, ensure compliance with regulations and standards, and address aging infrastructure challenges, and increase transparency and accountability.

Issues subject to regulation	Although reforms in the system of declarations (property, income and affiliated persons of high-ranking officials) are continuous, there are still several problems that exist in the sector.
In particular, the property and revenues of the heads and councils of elders of the communities of the Republic of Armenia are not known to the public, except for the property and revenues of the heads of communities with a population of 15,000 and more. At the same time, there are several indications in regard to the issue of conflict of interests of officials and members of councils of elders possessing funds from community budgets.  
The scope of property subject to declaration, pursuant to the Law of the Republic of Armenia “On public service”, is limited. In accordance with the specified law, declarants shall, among other properties, are obliged to only declare any expensive property with a value of more than AMD 8 million or more than the foreign currency equivalent thereto. The threshold value is very high, and due to this, the scope of property subject to declaration is not inclusive.
Based on the current legal regulations, gifts in the form of immovable, movable and expensive property, as well as gifts received in the form of money are subject to declaration. For the most part, the scope of data subject to declaration (content of declarations) does not provide the opportunity to reveal the relationship between the donor and the declarant. At the same time, in accordance with Decision of the Government of the Republic of Armenia No 1835-N of 15 December 2011, the data regarding the donor shall not be subject to publication. There is a problem regarding the protection of the data of a third party. As a result, this leads to various doubts and commentaries from the public. Meanwhile, if the data regarding the name, last name of the donor, as well as the relationship of the latter to the declarant are accessible to the public, the above-mentioned doubts on conflicts of interests will be dispelled. In this regard, although in accordance with the Law of the Republic of Armenia HO-206-N of 23 March 2018 ""On public service"", data on persons related to the declarant official through close kinship or in-law relationship: name, last name, father’s name, day, month, year of birth, relationship to the declarant official are also envisaged as general data subject to be included in a declaration; however, deciding on the issue of identifying (revealing the relationship to the declarant) the subjects (relative, godfather and others) beyond the scope of the above-mentioned persons as a donator, first and foremost implies revision of the content of a declaration. Besides, in regard to protection of personal data of a third party donor, publication of the declared data in regard to his or her name implies specification of the relevant regulations stipulated by the Law of the Republic of Armenia “On personal data protection”.
In the ""Registry of Declarations"" section of the website of the Commission, the search for declarations is carried out based on the following search characteristics of the official — ""Name, Surname"", ""Position"" and ""Year"". The “Registry of Declarations” is not accessible to users yet in terms of selection of the relevant data in the declarations according to a specific characteristic.

Main objective	Ensure transparency of data subject to declaration.
Brief Description of Commitment	1. Ongoing enlargement of the scope of declarants (members of councils of elders and secretaries of staffs of communities with populations of 15,000 and more).
2. Revision of content of declarations, including in regard to reduction of the threshold value of expensive property subject to declaration and identification of persons not affiliated to the declarant official through close kinship or in-law relationship as donators (revelation of relationship to the declarant).
3. Enlargement of the list of data of declarations subject to publication.
OGP challenge addressed by the commitment	Enhancement of public integrity
Relevance to OGP values	Transparency, accountability, technology
Ambition	By introducing the declarations registry interactive (searchable and user friendly) instrument, the Commission expects to receive from the interested groups of civil society more substantiated recommendations and applications in relation to alleged violations by declarant persons of the requirements set under the Law of the Republic of Armenia “On public service”. The number of applications submitted (through publications or by other means) to the Commission by interested groups of civil society is expected to grow as a result of the aforementioned, as well as legislative amendments. At the same time, it is expected to ensure rise of the level of accountability of declarant officials and increase confidence in them.

Issues subject to regulation        Although the legislation in the Republic of Armenia (RA) prohibits public officials to be engaged in business activities, the lack of information about the ultimate beneficial owners of legal entities may actually enable the violation of this requirement and contribute to the spread of corruption.

After the Velvet revolution in the spring of 2018 the new government launched a real and effective fight against corruption and the disclosure of information about property owners can significantly contribute to the realisation of the government’s ambitions. With this commitment the government will adopt international beneficial ownership transparency standards and will monitor abuses of company ownership for illegal purposes. Taking into account the open will of the new government to eliminate corruption in all spheres, government of RA pledged to ensure the publicity of data on the real owners of companies operating in the country.

Main objective        The main objective of the commitment is to open information on companies’ real owners to prevent and identify the misuse of company ownership for corruption offenses.

The publication of information of companies’ real owners will also support tax and law agencies to enforce the laws and regulations more effectively and carry out their functions and activities. The transparency of such information will promote the engagement of citizens in the fight against corruption and can increase trust in government. At the same time, it can have a positive effect in increasing investments in the Republic of Armenia.

Brief Description of Commitment        The Government is committed to develop and implement a common mechanism for identifying the real owners of companies operating in RA, by creating and launching a comprehensive open and freely accessible register of beneficial ownership.

OGP challenge addressed by the commitment        Publicity, accountability, enhancement of public integrity, innovation

Relevance to OGP values        The Register will provide access to actual owners’ information, increase public confidence, increase transparency and public control, and thereby improve the accountability of companies.

Ambition        The commitment is exclusive for Armenia and other OGP member countries. Armenia will have an effective tool for Civil society and the State agencies to determine the ultimate beneficial owners in all sectors of the economy operating in RA. This commitment is a comprehensive and inclusive program, which will lead to positive changes including a huge impact on the fight against corruption and money laundering. By doing so, Armenia will join the group of pioneer countries in the field of Beneficial ownership transparency.
Promotes efforts for implementation of SDG Goals or Targets        16.5 Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms.
17.17 encourage and promote effective public, public- private, and civil society partnerships, building on the experience and resourcing strategies of partnerships.

Ongoing Actions                
1.        Development of a legislative package that establishes the framework necessary to meaningfully advance on beneficial ownership transparency and implement an open register of ultimate beneficial owners. 
This legislative package will be based on a comprehensive analysis of international experiences on issues such as the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard, the definition of beneficial owners, verification and registration mechanisms, and the range of required documentation. 
In addition, the development of the legislative package will include consultations with stakeholders, such as representatives of civil society and the private sector, and the presentation of a consolidated package to the Prime Minister’s Staff.

Issues subject to regulation	Currently, there is a need to strengthen publicity, transparency and participation in the sphere of local self-governance. In particular, most of the communities of the republic are using the Community Management Information System (CMIS) created upon the initiative of the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Development of the Republic of Armenia (MTAD RA). Ensuring public accessibility of the CMIS on the Internet, community administrations also make the CMIS serve as an official website, providing the population of the community with access to information about their activities. Point 5 of Article 11 of the Law of the Republic of Armenia “On local self-governance” stipulates the obligation of communities to have an official website and the list of the minimum documents to be posted on the website with download functionality. The drawback of the official websites of communities is that, in spite of the fact that the information is provided to users, it is incomplete, and it does not ensure opportunity for residents to participate.
Main objective	The objective of the commitment is to raise the level of transparency and publicity of the activities of LSGs in communities of the Republic with populations of 3,000 or more, improve the quality and raise the level of accessibility and access of services provided to the population, as well as ensure participation.
Brief description of commitment	Within the scope of performance of the commitment, it is envisaged to enlarge the composition of information prescribed by the Law of the Republic of Armenia “On local self-governance” and to be posted on the websites of communities, including the following:
•	the budgets of institutions under the subordination of a community administration,
•	general information (type of activity, address, contacts, etc.) regarding institutions (educational, cultural, etc.) existing in the community and/or the website of those institutions (if available), 
•	information cards containing descriptions of the procedures for services provided by the community administration or the institutions operating under its subordination, which will present, in detail, information regarding the service concerned and information required for the beneficiary of the service, required documents, terms of provision, legal grounds, levies fees, etc.  
•	information on issuance of permits for advertisements, trade, construction and other types of permits,
•	information about theme parks, see-worthy sites, as well as historical and cultural sites located in the community (address, pictures, brief description),
•	information related to construction underway in the community through public funding,
•	application of the e-draft model in large communities (with 20000 or more residents), that is, posting on the website of the community administration the drafts of regulatory legal acts to be adopted by the head of community and council of elders of the community, for the purpose of informing and discussing.
OGP challenge addressed by the commitment	Raising the level of public confidence, more efficient management of public resources 
Relevant to OGP values	Transparency, publicity, participation, technology and innovation
Ambition	Availability of official community websites that will be more accessible and will contain more information for residents, enlargement of local participation

Accordingly, the strategic agendas of digitalization and public administration reforms of the Republic of Armenia consider the formation of institutional structures of data management in the country as an agenda priority, emphasizing first of all the formation of the legislative framework defining the general policy around data. Under the mentioned strategic agendas, the ideology of considering the data as public wealth is laid as the basis of the state policy. The establishment of a complete institutional and legislative system of data management is of the utmost importance not only for the effective delivery of the state system and state services, but also for increasing the productivity and competitiveness of the private sector. The formation of institutional and legislative foundations of data management is an opportunity to create a legal and citizen-centric design and operation of administrative information systems, the introduction of data access structures with the logic of open data policy, the introduction of citizen inquiries and traceability systems about their personal data, the interoperability of administrative information systems, data management standards, the scope of data-related rights and responsibilities, etc. At the moment, the policy and institutional arrangements regarding data and information systems in Armenia are fragmented and partial, they do not fully meet the developments of the time and the needs of the development of digital and virtual economy, public service provision and management systems. Therefore, it is necessary to develop and implement unified and comprehensive legal regulations, which will outline the entire field of data relations and enforcement mechanisms. With the legislative package defining the data policy, it is planned to develop: 1. The Law of the Republic of Armenia ""On Freedom of Information and Public Information"", the purpose of which is to ensure the realization of the right to receive information provided by the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia by providing effective and quality public services to the public and every person, as well as ensuring access to information defined by this law, which will enable to carry out public control over the performance of their duties by state bodies. The law will regulate relations related to freedom of information, will define the authority of information managers in the field of information provision, as well as regulate the conditions, procedure and methods of providing public information, receiving information and multiple use of information, the conditions and procedure for classifying, using and accessing restricted information. 2. RA Law ""On Cyber Security"", the main purpose of which is to create a cyber-safe environment in information systems and critical information infrastructures. The law will regulate the relations related to the detection of cyber incidents, their notification, prevention and resolution, monitoring, supervision and the application of measures of responsibility for compliance with the requirements of this law, as well as will define the scope of the subjects who are obliged to ensure the information systems and critical information they use. cyber security of infrastructures, their continuous, uninterrupted and safe use.

Problem Definition 
1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? The development of the legislation defining the data policy is aimed at the regulation of relations around the formation and use of data in Armenia, the formation of institutional frameworks with the adoption of the open data doctrine. RA legislation will form foundations and provide an opportunity to clarify the rights and responsibilities of data market participants, regulatory bodies and other institutional structures with the best available solutions, the legal framework necessary for providing safe and citizen-centric services, increasing the efficiency of the public administration system, promoting the competitiveness and efficiency of the economy, and developing the digital economy and digital society.

2. What are the causes of the problem? Currently, the principles and approaches of data policy, the system of rights and responsibilities related to data generation, processing, storage, exchange, use and distribution, security issues are regulated in a fragmented manner. Currently, in the context of the increasing volumes of the digital economy, the modernization and digitization processes of public administration and public services, there is an inevitable need for ensuring full regulation. The fragmentation of legal regulations defining the data policy hinders the implementation of the commitments declared by the State, aimed at ensuring the more effective, open, transparent and accountable management system.

Commitment Description 
1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? There is a legislation on personal data protection and freedom of information in place, which, however, does not provide the full and up-to-date legislative framework on the data policy. A working team has been formed within the Information Systems Management Council for the elaboration of legislation aimed at the introduction of data policy.

2. What are the solutions we propose? With the aim to address the problem, the Ministry of High-Tech Industry, in co-operation with interested institutions, has undertaken the implementation of the measure ""Formation of legislation defining the data policy"", which is also one of the goals declared by the 2021-2026 RA Government Programme and the strategy of Public Administration reforms.

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? The elaboration and adoption of data policy legislation will enable to fully regulate the field of relations for the digital economy, digital society and digital state and services, which will, in its turn, improve the quality of data, access and their safe management. The quality of services being provided to the public, the public confidence in state data and information systems, and the usage of digital services will significantly increase. As a final result, it is expected to create complete legal grounds critical for development of citizen-centred and data-based policy, and development of economy and digital society.

Commitment Analysis  
1. How will the commitment promote transparency? The legislation defining the data policy will include regulations on the rights and responsibilities of those carrying out actions regarding the data, their receipt, processing, storage, transmission and other actions; the system of rules related to data access and transparency will also be formed based on the doctrine of open data; legal grounds and standards for data catalogues and on ensuring public access to meta data will be provided. 

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? The standards of data classification, usage, quality assessment, identification, data protection and accurate distribution, risk management principles, responsibility and accountability, and other legal relations will be defined and specified by the legislation of the Republic of Armenia.

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? The elaboration and actual implementation of data legislation based on the open data policy will also contribute to the development of citizen-state communication and participatory management systems through the implementation of more intelligent and mutually reliable solutions and platforms. At the same time, the data legislation will also provide a sufficient legal infrastructure, which will make it possible to introduce public service quality monitoring, control and management systems, to encourage citizen-centric and citizen-experience-based design and delivery practices of public services.

AM0051,Armenia,5,6,ARM,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2022,2024,2,Institutional Development and Participation,Access to cartographic spatial data and metadata,Access to Geospatial Data,"Brief Description of the Commitment 
To ensure the access of basic cartographic spatial data, metadata to the public through the national geoportal, with the possibility of search, ensuring the personal data protection regime. The creation of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) will provide users with a continuously and online updated geoportal (district, plot, building, land fund, property type cadastral layers are updated automatically). The Geoportal will provide an opportunity to view, search, analyze and process spatial data from different sources on one platform (in accordance with Article 3, Clause 13 of the RA Law ""On Spatial Data"", base spatial data is universally available, nonconfidential (except for national (data collected for security and defense), digital data of spatial objects intended for open publication, separated by a stable spatial position in time and serving as a basis for orientation for other spatial objects, are the most used. Spatial data exchange will be ensured on the basis of the principle of interoperability between different state bodies.

Problem definition 
1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? The functions of maintaining cadastres (registers) of facilities, property and resources under the management of a number of RA economy management bodies are mostly not implemented or incompletely implemented, they operate independently of each other, the data are repeated, sometimes they are contradictory, which significantly makes it difficult for the management bodies to provide the necessary information. to ensure the process, and sometimes it makes it impossible to use the information or information systems available in various information databases for the efficiency of management, the development of effective programs or the effective implementation of programs of state importance. The solutions to the above-mentioned problems apply both to the state administration system and bodies created by law, and to individuals. The comprehensive geoportal will also provide an opportunity to analyze processes of public importance, such as declarations of officials, measures aimed at preventing corruption, etc.

2. What are the causes of the problem? The reason is that the information is not unique, because those structures that are primarily spatial data collectors and/or creators, as well as users of spatial data, use vector, raster (e.g. RTM, aerial imagery), paper maps (e.g. topographic maps, atlases), internet maps (openstreetmap, yandex map, google maps, google earth).

Commitment Description 
1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? According to the order of the head of the Cadastre Committee (N 149-L of June 18, 2021), the consultative body (working group) of the integrated cadastre National Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDA) attached to the head of the Cadastre Committee was established. The consultative body has already organized working sessions and started cooperation with the ""LX Korea"" company that arrived in Armenia in order to support the creation of the national infrastructure of the standardized spatial data of the Committee, implemented with the support of the Asian Development Bank. ATTE-spatial data group includes the following cartographic layers: 1. Cadastral spatial data includes: administrative boundaries (region, community, settlement, administrative district), real estate (building, plot, cadastral district), assessment (zoning of spatial assessment, assessment district, assessment group), right (property right subject, easement, lease (sublease), purpose and operational significance of land (land) and address cartographic layer groups. 2. Topographic spatial data includes: relief (horizons, digital model of relief, mountain peaks), surface water (river network, lakes, reservoirs), transport network (motorways, railways), plan elevation base (pickets, plan base, elevation base) and geographic name groups of cartographic layers. 3. Spatial data of aerial photography includes: overlay of orthophoto floor (orthophotos), mosaic element cartographic layers. 4. Thematic spatial data group consists of: specially protected areas of nature, natural disasters, agriculture, climate, infrastructure, environmental pollution and monitoring, forests, geology, production, distribution of animal and plant species, historical and cultural monuments, hydrography, transport network, land geography from spatial data. More than 600 spatial data metadata have been developed and imported into the National Spatial Data Infrastructure Geoportal. The Law HO-431-N ""On Amendments and Additions to the Law on Geodesy and Cartography"" was developed and adopted on December 10, 2021. With the mentioned change, relations related to spatial data, including spatial data infrastructure, were regulated at the level of the law. This legislative amendment envisages a number of legal regulations (laws: ""On Geodetic and Cartographic Activities, ""On Spatial Data"", ""On Amendments to the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Republic of Armenia""). For this purpose, the involvement of the government, the National Assembly and other professional structures is important.

2. What solution are you proposing? With this commitment, it is proposed to ensure the access of basic cartographic spatial data, metadata to the public through the creation of a national geoportal. ATTE will provide users with a continuously and online updated geoportal (district, plot, building, land fund, property type cadastral layers are updated automatically). Geoportal will provide an opportunity to view, analyze and process spatial data from different sources on one platform. The draft law ""On Spatial Data"" will define approaches to updating spatial data: data up-to-dateness and objectivity. Government agencies that collect, create and manage spatial data and provide spatial data sets and services shall create, provide and distribute relevant metadata, as well as maintain and update them in accordance with the spatial data sets and services. The rules for creating, maintaining and updating metadata of spatial data and services will be defined by the authorized body coordinating the fields. In accordance with the requirements of Article 75 of the Law ""On State Registration of Rights to Property"", Natural persons requesting their property or property rights, 11.1-12 and 15 (up to 10 pages of copied documents) of Part 1 of Article 73 of the Law ) are exempted from the information provision fee for the information specified in clauses. The information about the data of the unified state cadastre of real estate, except for unified information, to the RA President's Office, the RA Prime Minister's Office, the RA National Assembly's staff and deputies, RA state administration system bodies, RA regional governorates, courts, the RA Prosecutor's Office and other criminal prosecution bodies, the RA Central Bank , the RA Chamber of Accounts, autonomous bodies and independent state bodies, the RA human rights defender, the head of the public defender's office are provided free of charge for the exercise of their powers under RA law. The information provided to the bodies of the state administration system in the prescribed manner, as well as the cadastral, topographic or land construction maps can be transferred by the latter to other persons only on the basis of the decision of the Government, in return for which the state registry of real estate is allocated an appropriate compensation.

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? TThe implementation of ATTE will provide an opportunity to coordinate the existing geospatial data in the territory of RA and to create a single autonomous information resource based on regularly and online updated interconnected data. As a result, we will have: quick and efficient management of territories, economy, natural resources, environmental, urban development and other processes, saving financial resources and labor resources, increasing the level of public awareness, the service of obtaining comprehensive information will be improved, as well as the possibility of conducting public monitoring and other analytical works.

Commitment analysis 
1. How will the commitment promote transparency? The works performed by state bodies will be available to citizens through spatial data. Individuals or local self-government bodies of the RA requesting information about their property will be exempted from the fee for providing the information, except for the fees set for access to the national geoportal. Access to the national geoportal with the ability to search and view will be provided free of charge. Searching for metadata through the Geoportal will be free, and viewing and searching for some spatial data will be partially free.

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? The works performed by the state bodies will be reflected in the national geoportal, which will enable public control, and as a result, the accountability of the state administration system bodies and local governments will be improved.

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? Citizens will be given the opportunity to receive free information on spatial and metadata (except for some settings), as well as to respond to the information on the National Geoportal in the form of messages.

AM0052,Armenia,5,7,ARM,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2022,2024,2,Fight Against Corruption,Register of gifts related to the exercise of official duties of persons holding public positions and of public servants,Register of Gifts for Public Servants,"Brief Description of the Commitment 
In order to regulate the institution of gifts, which is a component of the welfare system, the definition of the body responsible for maintaining the ban on accepting gifts by public servants, as well as the provision of the necessary regulations regarding the order of accounting and delivery of gifts, in particular, the creation of a digital register of gift declaration, which will ensure the declaration of gifts, their evaluation, as well as automated information publishing solutions.

Problem definition 
1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? Article 29 of the RA Law ""On Public Service"" defines the prohibition of accepting gifts by public servants, Article 30 of the same law defines that accounting and delivery of gifts are carried out in accordance with the procedure established by the Government, which does not work, as a result of which the public service sector almost no accounting and handing over of gifts received by public servants during the performance of their official powers is carried out, in other words, no control function is performed in relation to this institution. Taking into account the reforms carried out in the public service sector, it is necessary to improve the institution of the prohibition of accepting gifts, establish a body that maintains the prohibition of accepting gifts, as well as establish the necessary regulations regarding the order of accounting and delivery of gifts, which will make the sector more controllable and transparent.

2. What are the causes of the problem? The processes of receiving and handing over gifts received by public servants during the performance of their official powers were generally not properly implemented due to legislative gaps, the lack of implementation of a unified policy in the field of public service and the supervisory body. The terms ""Gift"", ""Hospitality"", ""Permissible gift"" were not properly formulated, the procedure established by the Government, which is the basis for accounting and handing over gifts, established by Article 30 of the RA Law ""On Public Service"", did not work. At the same time, the control regulations regarding the fulfillment of the request for the prohibition of accepting gifts, the acceptance of permissible gifts and the fulfillment of their accounting requirements and the authorized body performing this function are not defined. Under such conditions, a differentiated approach was implemented for different types of public service, as a result of which the implementation of the unified policy was disrupted. In addition, there is no gift registry.

Commitment Description 
1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? In 2018, the Law of the Republic of Armenia ""On public service"" was adopted, Chapter 7 of which is fully devoted to the integrity system. The prohibition on acceptance of gifts by public servants was included in the integrity system and, as a component of the integrity system, was one of the tools for ensuring the transparency and managing corruption risks in public service. Nevertheless, the existing legislative gaps did not provide the opportunity to prescribe procedures for registration and transfer of gifts that are applicable in practice and effective. That is why in 2021 the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Armenia and the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption conducted a comprehensive study and analysis of legislation with the support of the Council of Europe Office in Yerevan, identifying all the gaps existing in the regulations. Within the scope of the mentioned, the draft laws on making amendments and supplements to the Law ""On public service"" and related laws (hereinafter referred to as ""drafts"") were elaborated by the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption. The drafts were put to public discussion in May 2022 (as it was in OGP new draft) and submitted to interested bodies for opinion. The Government gave approval to the drafts on August 18, 2022, and they were submitted to the National Assembly.

2. What solution are you proposing? The Corruption Prevention Commission has developed a concept and action plan for the improvement of the framework for the prohibition of accepting gifts by persons holding public positions and public servants, which is reflected in the action plan of the RA government. Within the framework of the mentioned, as already mentioned, a package of relevant projects was developed, with which it is proposed to implement the following main changes: 1) consolidate the regulations providing for restrictions on receiving gifts by persons holding public office and public servants into one legal act, the Law ""On Public Service"", implementing relevant amendments to ""On Public Service"", ""On Corruption Prevention Commission"", ""On Civil Service"", "" On Prosecution"" and a number of other related laws. In this way, uniformity of regulations on restrictions on accepting gifts by persons holding public office and public servants will be ensured and the presence of different regulations in different laws will be excluded. At the same time, it is proposed to establish administrative responsibility for persons holding public positions and public servants instead of disciplinary responsibility in case of violation of limits on accepting gifts. 2) establish the obligation to record gifts in the gift register for public office holders and public servants. It has been established that the procedure for accounting, delivery and evaluation of gifts, maintaining the Registry, the list of data to be filled in and published in the Registry, the procedures for making changes in the submitted data, providing an advisory opinion, and providing information on cases of violation of gift acceptance restrictions shall be established by the Corruption Prevention Commission. It is planned that the register of gifts will be managed by the Corruption Prevention Commission. 3) drafts propose to clarify the range of permissible gifts, to set a minimum monetary threshold for the accounting of gifts (that is, AMD 20 thousand), to revise the concept of gifts based on the conclusions and recommendations issued within the framework of international obligations; 4) the drafts also propose to establish clear regulations regarding restrictions on accepting gifts by family members and related persons of public office holders and public servants; 5) drafts propose to establish clear structures regarding the activities carried out by persons holding public positions and public servants and authorized state bodies within the framework of the received gift, etc.

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? With the adoption by the National Assembly of the draft law ""On Amendments and Additions to the RA Law ""On Public Service"" and Related Laws"", it will be possible to control the gifts received by public servants and persons holding public office during the performance of their official powers, as well as the definition of a central body that will implement proper and unified policy in the field of application of the legal norms of the prohibition of accepting gifts, to ensure the unity of legal regulations providing for restrictions on the prohibition of accepting gifts by persons holding public positions and public servants, including them only in the Law of the Republic of Armenia ""On Public Service"" and extending them to all areas and types of public service, establish more clear and targeted legal regulations that will allow for proper containment of corruption risks, the creation of a digital register of gifts, which will provide automated solutions for declaring gifts, evaluating them, publishing information, as well as ensuring the interoperability of the system with the digital system of declarations. A person holding a public office and a public servant will be required to record the permissible gifts received by them in the gift accounting register. According to the Project, the procedures for accounting, delivery and evaluation of gifts, maintaining the Registry, the list of data to be filled and published in the Registry, the procedures for making changes to the submitted data, providing an advisory opinion, and providing information on cases of violations of gift acceptance restrictions are defined by the Corruption Prevention Commission. In accordance with the procedure established by the draft law, the Commission will maintain the registers of accounting of gifts of persons holding public office and public servants, in addition, it will examine and resolve cases regarding violations related to restrictions on accepting gifts. According to the draft, the procedures for making changes in data, providing an advisory opinion, and providing information on cases of violation of gift acceptance restrictions are defined by the Corruption Prevention Commission. At the same time, in case of non-compliance with the requirements of the legislative acts related to gifts, the Corruption Prevention Commission will apply measures of responsibility.

Commitment Analysis
1. How will the commitment promote transparency? Upon the implementation of the obligation, it is expected to define more comprehensibly the prohibition on acceptance of gifts, by precluding possible misconceptions and opportunities to bypass them, ensure the publicity of declared gifts, introduce a system for publication of reports, as well as create an opportunity for downloading open data.

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? An important condition is the creation of a digital register of gifts, which will provide automated solutions for mandatory declaration of gifts, their evaluation, and information publication. The gift registry will be publicly accessible, both for use and for information retrieval, such as the property, income declaration system. The introduction of a control mechanism by the public is key: any person will have the opportunity to submit a report to the Corruption Prevention Commission on apparent violations of gift declaration and accounting.

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? Inclusiveness is one of the most important components of the commitment. Increasing the possessiveness of the public over the processes being implemented. Proper public supervision and exigence over persons responsible for the implementation of the action and the resources allocated.

AM0055,Armenia,5,10,ARM,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2022,2024,2,Social Rights and Protection,Implementation of a digital system for accounting and concluding employment (labor) contracts for the public and private sectors,Electronic System of Employment Contracts,"Brief Description of the Commitment 
Through the introduction of a digital system for recording and concluding labor contracts in RA, to digitize labor contracts (individual legal acts on employment) signed in both the public and private sectors of RA, in order to improve the system of free choice of work and protection of labor rights. The electronic management system will enable employees to have employment contracts that meet the requirements set by RA legislation, and the Health and Labor Inspection Authority (hereinafter, the inspection authority) will have a more transparent, accountable, controllable and legal protection toolkit. In particular, as a result of the implementation of the system, employees will have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the content of their employment contract, and in case of violation of the terms of the employment contract, refer to the specific point of the contract and submit a complaint to both the employer and the inspection body. On the other hand, the inspection body will have the opportunity to carry out effective control based on both monitoring and submitted complaints, identifying violations of labor legislation, including labor contract conditions, and improving workers' rights and protection. At the same time, based on the results of the analysis of the above problems, the inspection body will have the opportunity to more effectively evaluate and determine the employers with a high-risk level in order to include them in the annual inspection program. In addition, the presence of the platform will exclude the established practice in the private sector of concluding back-number contracts, not registering the actual work performed in the tax authority (illegal work), or specifying in the contract an amount less than the actual salary.

Problem Definition 
1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? The commitment is aimed at increasing the level of free choice of work and protection of labor rights of RA employees, as well as risk management in the field of labor law. Employers, especially in the private sector, very often do not sign employment contracts (or do not adopt individual legal acts on employment) or individual legal acts on employment, job description/job passport (not applicable to the civil service system), or employment contracts with new employees. are not provided to employees, which subsequently makes it difficult, and sometimes even impossible, to protect the labor rights of employees and control over labor legislation. And already during the inspection, the labor contract is drawn up on paper, signed by the employee and presented as a previously signed document. It is also a related problem when the employee is accepted for such a job, in which case the initial and therefore the periodic medical examination is mandatory. Moreover, there are often cases when private sector employers specify the amount of salary in employment contracts at the minimum monthly salary provided by law, in order to avoid tax and other state payments stipulated by legislation, about which the employee often does not have any information due to not having the opportunity to familiarize himself with the contract. Another problem is when a person is hired to perform work required by the employer, corresponding to his profession, but due to not sign an employment contract or due to the fact that the contract was signed for another position (real estate unit) instead of the work actually performed, duties different from the work actually performed are stipulated in the contract. able to justify that he performed professional work, he does not receive both the supplements and other social guarantees provided for by the law. For example, a person actually carrying out professional work, which at the same time is provided by the legislation of the Republic of Armenia as particularly difficult, particularly harmful works, professions and positions in the list, is registered by the employer for another position (substance) in the relevant company, without paying the supplements provided for by law, for the specified works for not providing other guarantees, and later, the person who performed the mentioned work is deprived of the opportunity to calculate the professional work performed by him in the professional internship, as well as the allowances available to him and other social guarantees provided by the state. In the public sector, there are often cases when the employee is provided with the individual legal act on hiring, but the job description (passport of the position) is not provided with the order, as a result of which the civil servant carries out the instructions given by his direct supervisor, without having a clear idea of his main job duties. about The above-mentioned problems are especially common in marzes and small communities, but in the city of Yerevan, similar problems are regularly raised during inspections. Among the mainly affected groups, we can single out people who are socially insecure, who have a low level of legal awareness, who do not have the opportunity to be employed in other ways than the proposed conditions, and who occupy low positions (property units) in the public sector. The absence of a digital system for recording and signing employment contracts enables employers to show an unscrupulous approach to employees by not providing and distorting the terms of the employment contract, depriving employees of effective means of protecting their rights, and the inspection body of effective control tools. Effective inspection control in the field of labor law, of which the digital system of registering and concluding labor contracts will become an integral part and control tool, will create an opportunity to minimize similar cases mentioned above.

2. What are the causes of the problem? Employers sometimes consider the compulsory existence of an employment contract (individual legal act on employment) or its provision to employees as unimportant. In addition, even if an employment contract is signed (an individual legal act on hiring is adopted), the next issue is its content or the reflection of the minimum conditions defined by the RA labor legislation (for example, the year, month, date of starting work, the validity period of the employment contract, type of annual leave (minimum, additional, extended) and duration, pay, etc.). According to the current legislation, the employment contract (individual legal act on hiring) clearly stipulates the name of the position and (or) work functions or a reference to the document defining the functions arising from the position, the amount of the basic salary (including taxes paid from the salary, social or other mandatory payments defined by law ) and the way of determining it (hourly, daily, wage rate or monthly rate), supplements, bonuses, additional payments given to employees in the prescribed manner, working time regime (normal duration of working time or part-time working time or reduced duration of working time or total calculation of working time) and weekly duration (except for the sum calculation of working hours), etc., but in practice, employees are actually required to perform functions not provided for by the employment contract (individual legal act on employment) in an amount different from the amount of salary specified in the employment contract (individual legal act on employment), supplements, bonuses are not provided , allowances, durations of working time and rest time are not observed, etc. At the same time, the employment contract (individual legal act on employment) is sometimes not provided to employees for not registering their work activities with the tax authority (illegal work) or for registering less than the amount of wages actually provided, as well as for violating the terms of the contracts (individual legal act on employment). in order to refrain from complaints addressed by the employee to the employer or the inspection body. Moreover, employers often sign service contracts with employees instead of employment contracts in order to circumvent the basic principles and guarantees of labor legislation. These issues became more apparent during the pandemic (Covid-19) and war. One of the reasons for the mentioned problems is the lack of sufficient tools for the inspection body to carry out control with modern regulations.

Commitment Description 
1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? As a result of the changes made within the framework of the inspection reforms, starting from September 2013, the authorized body exercising state control over labor legislation, according to the regulations in force until July 2020, was entrusted only with the control of relations related to the maintenance of health and safety of employees and persons under 18 years of age, as well as pregnant or control powers over the provision of labor law guarantees for breastfeeding women and child care workers. From July 1, 2021, the Health and Labor Inspection Authority has been given the authority to exercise full control over labor legislation. At the same time, until July 1, 2021 (before the entry into force of the above-mentioned legislative amendments), when a state of emergency was declared in the Republic of Armenia due to the coronavirus pandemic from March 2020, and then quarantine, amendments were made to the RA Labor Code and the Administrative in the RA Code on Offenses. Legal practice shows that very often the procedure for concluding labor contracts is violated by employers due to a lack of knowledge of labor legislation. The Health and Labor Inspection Authority continuously implements labor rights awareness activities, which, however, do not yield satisfactory results.

2. What solution are you proposing? In order to improve and increase the effectiveness of the tools of state control over labour legislation, it is proposed to introduce a digital system for recording and concluding labour contracts, which will help employers conclude labour contracts in accordance with the procedure established by legislation (adopting individual legal acts on hiring in accordance with the procedure prescribed by legislation), activities involving labour relations artificially not to be transferred to the civil law field, to register the work activity in the tax field in accordance with the legislation, in a simultaneous mode, the signed labour contracts (accepted individual legal acts on hiring) will be available at any time. The procedure for concluding employment contracts (adoption of individual legal acts on employment) by employers is often violated due to a lack of knowledge of labour legislation, and to solve the problem, it is planned to conclude employment contracts in the digital system (adoption of individual legal acts on employment) to implement individual employment agreements in labour contracts by filling in the relevant fields reflected in the system regarding the conditions to be included in the legal act defined by RA legislation. The introduction of a digital system for recording and concluding employment contracts itself implies the establishment of appropriate legal regulations by law. In particular, the law (Labour Code of the Republic of Armenia) will define the duty of employers to sign employment contracts or accept individual legal acts on employment through the system. For violating the mentioned duty, the law (the RA Code on Administrative Offenses) will provide for the application of an administrative penalty, as well as the authority to issue instructions (mandates) to the business entity (the RA Law ""On the Organization and Conduct of Inspections in the Republic of Armenia""). Moreover, in case of non-fulfilment of the mentioned duty, the inspection body will be authorized to initiate administrative proceedings based on the complaints submitted by the employees, as well as on the cases revealed by it during the control or on the basis of the information received during the work activity, applying appropriate intervention measures against economic entities. The digital system (platform) for recording and concluding employment contracts will be implemented in the electronic management system of the RA State Revenue Committee https://file-online.taxservice.am, and for individuals/physical persons, the contract will be visible in the income declaration system, and the system can be integrated as https://file-online.taxservice.am, https://e-citizen.am/ platform, as well as be accessible to the electronic systems of other state bodies, in accordance with the competences and technical maturity of each. With this action, citizens can find their employment contract along with their passport, registration, driver's license, movable property, family status, civil registry, notary, educational and other data, as well as find out which bodies have made these inquiries about the data.

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? As a result of the implementation of the digital system for accounting and concluding labor contracts, the inspection body will have the opportunity to provide proper control with more optimal resources, the transparency of the labor market will be improved, the role of the human factor and the risk of corruption in the labor rights control process will be reduced, it will be possible to carry out state control without visiting economic entities, to highlight violations of labor rights. cases through monitoring (for example, if a person is employed in a profession (miner, construction worker, food industry worker, etc.) for which it is mandatory for the employer to provide preliminary and periodic medical examination, the system informs the inspection body about this, in respect of which control is established (availability of necessary documents, deadlines, etc.), to carry out effective state control on the basis of received applications/complaints regarding labor law violations. The system will contribute to the accountability of employer-employee relations and the improvement and modernization of the system of protection of workers' rights, through the system, the employee will receive his copy of the labor contract digitally, and the employer will not be able to change it or refuse to perform it during state control. Within the framework of the implementation of the digital system of concluding labor contracts and accounting, it is necessary to provide solutions for those cases when labor relations arise with an individual legal act on employment.

Commitment Analysis 
1. How will the commitment promote transparency? Within the framework of the implementation of the digital system of concluding labor contracts and accounting, it is necessary to provide solutions for those cases when labor relations arise with an individual legal act on employment.On the one hand, as a result of providing access to the data related to each employee to the digital system of recording and concluding labor contracts, the opportunity and right to monitor their work activities and manage the necessary information will be ensured for employees, as well as the possibility of its realization, in particular, to submit an application-complaint to the employer or an inspection body. on the other hand, the transparency of the state control over the fulfillment of the requirements of the labor legislation will be ensured, in the way of reducing the human factor and corruption risks.

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? As a result of the implementation of the digital system for accounting and concluding labor contracts, the relevant inspection body exercising control and other public agencies with access to the system will have clear data on the content of labor contracts (individual legal acts on hiring) signed in the labor market, the new toolkit in the field of control over the fulfillment of labor law requirements will contribute to accountability, including the provision of more detailed annual or quarterly reports by the authorized inspection body of the sector on detected violations and sanctions, while expanding the scope of information on labor rights, their possible violations, compensation opportunities and the application of sanctions, both substantive and result data growth, which it will be possible to make it a subject of public control at any time, which in turn will give an opportunity to evaluate the activities of the RA government in this field. At the same time, the possibility of providing access to the data related to the system for each employee will contribute to increasing the level of accountability of employee-employer relations.

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? Citizens will have the opportunity to report violations of labor rights and other issues by alerting the inspection body. Control by citizens will contribute to the regulation of labor relations (in particular, alerting about material violations, about the employer's failure to properly fulfill obligations) and increase the protection of social guarantees.

Commitment description
What is the public problem that the commitment will address?

Government data offers significant opportunity for innovation in Government services. economic enterprise. research and development and transparency. Greater availability of data held by government increases transparency and openness.
The Productivity Commission identified existing data governance arrangements are complex and prevent the use and reuse of data. The PC found barriers to sharing include a dense web of legislative requirements. a culture of risk aversion and a lack of a whole of government approach. The PC found these barriers could be addressed through reforms to the way data sharing and use is governed.
The Australian Government has committed to implementing a simpler. more efficient data sharing and release framework by establishing:
•        a new Commonwealth Data Sharing and Release Act to streamline access and use of data; and
•        a new National Data Commissioner (NDC) to oversee the framework and legislation. and issue guidance and support to agencies to meet the new requirements.
The new Data Sharing and Release Act will:
•        promote better sharing of data held by the Australian Government;
•        build trust in use of public data;
•        dial up or down appropriate safeguards;
•        maintain the integrity of the data system; and
•        establish institutional arrangements.
What is the commitment? 
Building on commitments under Australia's first National Action Plan. this commitment focuses on the implementation of data governance reforms announced by the Australian Government in May 2078. These reforms will increase data access and use within government and with trusted users outside government. while improving data privacy and security with strengthened and consistent safeguards.
PM&C commits to consulting across government. through the new National Data Advisory Council (see current Action Plan). with the Open Government Forum and with the public including businesses. civil society groups and research and non-profit sectors to design and develop the implementation of the reforms.
As a first step. the Government has released an Issues Paper for public feedback and comments  by l  August. The paper outlines an approach to a new  Data Sharing and Release Bill which aims to balance sharing data held by government with appropriate risk management.
As committed under Australia's first National Action Plan. the National Data Advisory Council will be a multi-disciplinary expert panel drawn from public sector and civic society organisations.
How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem?
The reforms aim to promote better sharing of public sector data while building the public's trust in use of public data by ensuring appropriate safeguards and integrity in the data system.
To do this. we need to ensure that the implementation of the reforms is consistent with community values and expectations. This commitment will build consultation into the implementation and monitoring of the reforms.
The new legislation will exist alongside existing legislation and data safeguards in the Privacy Act 1988; Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017; Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code; Archives Act 1983. National Archives of Australia information management standards and Digital Continuity 2020 Policy, and Protective Security Policy Framework requirements relating to releasing classified information.
Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?
This commitment for these reforms is relevant to several OGP values in the following ways:
Access to information
•        The reforms. in particular the Data Sharing and Release Act. will streamline the sharing of data held by government to those within and external to the system while maintaining strong safeguards around data access.
Civic participation
•        This commitment will build consultation into the implementation and monitoring of the reforms. including through the National Data Advisory Council (a commitment under the current National Action Plan).
Public accountability
•        The Data Sharing and Release Act will require increased transparency on how data is shared across government.
Greater sharing and better use of data will improve agencies· ability to evaluate policies and programs effectively.

AU0024,Australia,3,1,AUS,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2023,2025,2,NA,Create transparency in the use of automated decision making and artificial intelligence,Transparency of Automated Decision Making,"Summary

The purpose of this commitment is to ensure greater transparency about the use of automated decision-making (ADM) in government and contribute to safe and responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) while facilitating innovation. This is intended to be achieved through: • improved governance, capability and guidance to support the safe and responsible use of AI in Australia • consideration of a consistent legal framework governing automated decision making by Australian Government agencies, and • enhanced transparency and protections for personal information handling by entities subject to the Privacy Act 1988. 

Why this commitment is important 

Delivery of this commitment aims to address community concerns about the transparency and integrity of decisions made using ADM systems, and about the safe and responsible use of AI. It is important that there is a consistent legal framework to support the use of automated decision-making, so that government services can operate ethically, without bias and with appropriate safeguards. There is also a need to support the transparency and integrity of decisions made using ADM systems including that individuals should be able to request meaningful information about how automated decisions, with a legal or similarly significant effect, are made when using personal information. These objectives are reflected both in the Government’s response to the Robodebt Royal Commission which committed to consider options for a consistent legal framework for ADM, and the Government’s response to the Privacy Act Review Report. Greater transparency about the use of ADM is part of fostering the public trust Australia needs to fully realise the benefits of AI, including opportunities for enhancing productivity, facilitating economic growth, and improving outcomes for Australians across health, education, environment and national security. This work will support the Australian Government to make advancements in this rapidly developing area and establish governance mechanisms to ensure AI is developed and used safely and responsibly in Australia. These mechanisms can include regulations, standards, tools, frameworks, principles and business practices.

Other relevant information e.g. inquiries, research work being undertaken 

The Department of Industry, Science and Resources (DISR) recently held public consultation on Safe and Responsible AI, which resulted in more than 500 responses reaffirming community expectations around transparency in the use of AI technologies, particularly by government. The Australian Government is currently reviewing these submissions. On 19 September 2023, the Hon Ed Husic MP, Minister for Industry and Science, and Senator Katy Gallagher, Minister for Finance, announced the establishment of the AI in Government Taskforce to focus on the safe and responsible use of AI within government. The Taskforce reports to the Secretaries Board Future of Work Sub-committee and is jointly led by the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) and DISR. It is developing approaches for governance, risk management, skills and capability, and technical use and preparedness for AI at a whole-of-government level. The Attorney-General’s Department is progressing work on the Government Response to the Privacy Act Review Report, which was released on 28 September 2023, which includes agreement to proposals regarding the use of ADM (proposals 19.1–19.3). The Government Response to the Robodebt Royal Commission committed to considering opportunities for legislative reform to introduce a consistent legal framework in which automation in government services can operate ethically, without bias and with appropriate safeguards, which will include consideration of review pathways and transparency mechanisms (recommendation 17.1). OGP Global has further recommendations on digital governance and automated decisionmaking in their Open Government Guide.

The Government will introduce new requirements for companies to record information about who ultimately owns, controls and receives benefits from a company operating in Australia. 

Why this commitment is important 

This commitment ensures that adequate, accurate and up-to-date information on beneficial ownership and control is available in a timely manner to relevant authorities and the public. This information will increase corporate accountability, and help to address and prevent tax evasion, money laundering, terrorism financing, and corruption. This commitment will advance the OGP values of transparency and accountability in business by: • improving the effectiveness of our legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks • preventing the misuse of corporate structures for illicit purposes such as corruption, tax evasion and money laundering, and • protecting the integrity of the financial system. 

Related OGP challenge areas 

• Access to information • Anti-corruption 

How the impact of this commitment can be measured 

The key measure of success for this commitment will be its effectiveness in contributing to the prevention of companies and legal arrangements being used for criminal purposes, tax evasion, or to avoid sanctions. This will be measured through reviewing the compliance of in-scope companies with new requirements and the accuracy of the information collected. Success will also be measured via Australia’s assessment under international commitments such as the Financial Action Task Force mutual evaluation process.

Other relevant information e.g. inquiries, research work being undertaken 

The Government committed to implement a public beneficial ownership register for companies and other legal vehicles as part of its ‘Multinational Tax Integrity Package’. Treasury undertook a consultation process in late 2022 on a staged approach to the implementation of the Government’s commitment. OGP Global has further information on beneficial ownership in other jurisdictions in their Open Government Guide.

This commitment recognises ongoing work to deliver staged reform of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 (PID Act). The PID Act establishes the Commonwealth public sector whistleblowing scheme. The first stage of reforms is complete. The second stage of reforms seeks to address the underlying complexity of the public sector whistleblowing framework and improve protections for whistleblowers. 

Why this commitment is important 

It is essential to public sector integrity that there is an effective framework in place that supports public sector whistleblowers to speak up about wrongdoing, and protects them from adverse consequences when they do so. 

Related OGP challenge areas 

• Anti-corruption • Justice 

How the impact of this commitment can be measured 

This commitment will be measured through the delivery of the staged reform process. Stage 1 reforms were delivered through the passage of the PID Amendment (Review) Act 2023, which commenced on 1 July 2023. The Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, supported by AGD, continue to undertake work to support implementation of those reforms. Stage 1 reforms to the PID Act implemented 21 of 33 recommendations of the Moss Review, along with recommendations from previous parliamentary reports. Work on stage 2 reforms is underway and will include public consultation in 2023 on further reforms to the PID Act to address the underlying complexity of the scheme and consider the need for additional supports for public sector whistleblowers, including if a Whistleblower Protection Authority is needed. The remaining recommendations of the Moss Review and other relevant inquiries will be considered in stage 2 reforms to the PID Act.

Other relevant information e.g. inquiries, research work being undertaken 

The PID Act has been in operation for approximately 10 years and has been the subject of multiple inquiries recommending areas for reform. These include: • 2016 Review of the PID Act by Mr Philip Moss AM (Moss Review) • 2017 report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into whistleblower protections in the corporate, public and not-forprofit sectors (PJCCFS report) • 2020 report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security inquiry into the impact of the exercise of law enforcement and intelligence powers on the freedom of the press (PJCIS report) • 2021 report of the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee into freedom of the press, and • 2021 Set the Standard report on the Independent Review into Commonwealth Parliamentary Workplaces.

The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) Interim Report into the 2022 Federal Election (Interim Report) made recommendations that the Government consider reforms to: • lower donation disclosure thresholds • expedite reporting of donations • cap political donations and electoral expenditure • establish campaign accounts • introduce a new system of campaign funding; and • govern ‘truth’ in political advertising. The Government responded to the Interim Report in November 2023. The Government has commenced engagement across the 47th Parliament with a view to securing multi-partisan support for legislative reform. 

Why this commitment is important 

Expedited disclosure of donations, limits on donations and expenditure and transparent electoral communication support representative democracy by assisting the public in the exercise of their franchise to make informed judgements about candidates, political parties, and other actors that seek to influence election outcomes.

How the impact of this commitment can be measured 

The Government has responded to the recommendations of the JSCEM Interim Report. These recommendations have been confirmed with the release of the final report on 27 November 2023. The Government will pursue multi-partisan support for reform – and the outcomes of that engagement will be key to the progress of reform. With multi-partisan support, the Government will introduce legislation to the 47th Parliament.

The Convention on Access to Official Documents - CETS 205 of the Council of Europe is the first and so far the only international agreement on access to information of an intergovernmental organization of which the Republic of Bulgaria is a member. At the moment, 18 Member States of the Council of Europe have signed the Convention and 11 of them have ratified it. The Convention entered into force on December 1, 2020. The Republic of Bulgaria has not ratified the convention. Regardless of the fact that the Law on Access to Public Information was adopted and is in effect more than 20 years ago and Bulgaria has extensive experience in its implementation, for the accession to the leading international act in this matter, it is necessary to assess whether all the requirements of the Convention are met in our national legislation. 

What does the measure consist of? The aim of the measure is to bring the Bulgarian legislation in line with the requirements of the Convention on Access to Official Documents. A possible consequence of its implementation will be the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria to this international act. 

How will the implementation of the measure contribute to solving the problem? With the implementation of the measure, actions will be taken to bring the Bulgarian legislation in line with the principles and standards of the Convention, which will be a guarantee that Bulgaria can take the path of joining the Convention.

BG0083,Bulgaria,4,5,BGR,Europe,National,1,2022,2024,2,Good Governance and Anti-Corruption,Implementation of effective public control during inspections in livestock and other animal breeding facilities,Public Control during Inspections in Livestock and Breeding Facilities,"What is the public problem being addressed by the measure? The provisions of Art. 57 in connection with Art. 58, item 5 of the Civil Code and Art. 170, para. 2 of the Law on Veterinary Arrangements (LVA) provide for the right of non-profit organizations for the protection of animals to carry out public control by participating in the inspections of the control authorities. However, the legal framework lacks an order for the exercise of the said right. In practice, the control authorities refuse to include the organizations in the orders for carrying out inspections or in another act that would ensure their admission to the inspected site, due to the lack of an explicit legal basis for this. This way, the assessment of whether an organization should participate in an inspection is left to the inspected person, regardless of the rights expressly recognized by law. The inspected person, on their part, in most cases refuses to allow non- governmental organizations into their facility. In view of the above, the legally provided rules for public control, through participation in inspections, are not applied in practice. The implementation of the measure will ensure a clear order for public control to be carried out together with the control authorities. This way, transparency will be guaranteed when inspections are carried out under the order of the Law on Animal Protection (LAP) and LVA and the long- standing obstruction of civil participation in activities to ensure humane treatment of animals 20 will be ended. It is necessary to take into account that non-profit organizations do not perform the functions of an administrative punitive body when they participate, in the sense of the LAP and LVA, in inspections, and their presence guarantees transparency and legality in the implementation of state control in relation to animal welfare. The control body's declaration of will, with which its act includes representatives of the organizations to participate in an inspection, would only certify the existence of the legal grounds for a specific organization to participate in a specific inspection. Such a declaration of will would not create control powers within the meaning of administrative penal law. 

What does the measure consist of? The measure consists in carrying out the following activities: Creation of a special working group under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture, with the participation of the interested state expert and control bodies and the representatives of the non- governmental sector, with the following tasks: ü Preparation of an analysis of the effect of the application of the current legislation for the implementation of public control, through participation/presence during inspections of the control bodies in livestock and other facilities for raising animals on the basis of Art. 57 in connection with Art. 58, item 5 of the Civil Code and Art. 170, para. 2 of LVA. ü Development of a project for amendment and supplement of the LVA and LAP, which would provide for an order for participation in inspections of the control bodies in animal breeding and other facilities for raising animals on the basis of Art. 57 in connection with Art. 58, item 5 of the Civil Code and Art. 170, para. 2 of LVA. 21 Conducting public discussion and public debate on the developed project. Coordination within the Council of Ministers and submission of the project to the Council of Ministers for consideration and acceptance. 

How will the implementation of the measure contribute to solving the problem? The implementation of the measure will enable the National Assembly to consider and adopt an amendment and supplement to the current legislation, which will overcome the gap in the legal provisions and the established difficulties in law enforcement. 

How does the measure relate to the values of the initiative? The measure is mainly related to the values of the Initiative – transparency, civic participation and accountability. The legal rules for public control, expressed in the possibility of participation of non-governmental organizations in inspections of the control bodies under the LVA and the LAP, are an important tool that can guarantee transparency and legality in the exercise of the powers of the control bodies. Public control has been introduced in the regulatory framework in order to enable interaction between control bodies and non-governmental organizations and civil participation in ensuring the protection of animal welfare. On one hand, non-governmental organizations can assist the competent authorities with expertise and assistance to injured, neglected or abused animals, and on the other, it is a protective mechanism that allows the public to be informed whether animal protection and welfare rules are actually being followed and, accordingly, whether the necessary measures are taken when there are established violations. The real implementation of public control ensures transparency of the execution of the powers of the control bodies, prevents corrupt practices and provides additional guarantees for timely and adequate intervention in the protection of animals and ensuring the required humane treatment. Last but not least, public scrutiny will help build public confidence in animal welfare control and increase accountability.

Although it was adopted after the democratic changes in the country, the Law on Direct Citizen Participation in State and Municipal Governance (LDCPDMG) does not create sufficient conditions to promote direct participation. In order for it to provide an opportunity to Bulgarian citizens for effective direct participation in decision-making, it is necessary to adopt changes in the following guidelines: - Reduce the number of required signatures and facilitate the procedures for initiating a referendum; - Reduce the amount of personal data that is collected for the initiation of a referendum and a citizen's initiative; - Lower the threshold for recognizing the validity of the referendum result; - Introduce the possibility of national electronic petition for national and local civil initiative; - Expand the scope of topics that can be submitted to a referendum; - Introduce machine voting in referendums; - Specifying the procedure, deadlines and sanctions for the implementation of the decisions of the referendums and initiatives. 

What does the measure consist of? The following activities are foreseen in order to implement the measure: 1. Create a work group with the participation of the stakeholders. The initiator of the work group will the Administration of the Council of Ministers or a Ministry chosen by it. 2. Analysis of the practices and results from the application of the Law in Bulgaria and comparative analysis with the practices and legislation in other countries, and preparing recommendations. 3. Preparing a concept for the changes in the Law based on the recommendations made. 4. Conducting a wide public consultation trough the use of various channels and forms of public consultation with the stakeholders - forums, focus groups, written online consultations etc. 5. Conducting an information campaign for the need and proposition of changes in the Law. 6. Preparing and coordinating in the CM of a final draft of a Law on Amendments and Supplements (LAS) and conducting a public consultation. 7. Introducing the LAS and the results of the consultation in the NA. Discussion with the members of the Public Council. 

How will the implementation of the measure contribute to solving the problem? By definition, public consultation and adoption of changes in the LDCPDMG, its implementation by Bulgarian citizens, civil groups, local authorities, initiative committees and others will be facilitated. The specific changes to which the measure would lead are the following: - Citizens will actively and effectively use their constitutional right to direct participation in decision- making at the local and national level; - Local and national authorities will be open to citizens' proposals on issues important to them and will comply with the citizens' ""agenda""; - Bulgarian society will be familiar and well informed about the possibilities of direct participation in decision-making. 

How does the measure relate to the values of the initiative? The direct participation of citizens in local and national governance is a right guaranteed by the Bulgarian constitution. Civic activity and involvement guarantees transparency and openness of governance. Conducting a broad consultative process of development and adoption of the LAS will create and establish standards for effective public consultations in the process of proposing and adopting legislative changes. 

More information (including budget for implementation of the measure) The implementation of the measure requires: - Human resources for the definition of the LAS of the LDCPDMG: legal support for the development of LAS; - Expert support - analysis of experience and practices in other countries; - Conducting public discussions and public consultation on the proposed LAS; - Advocacy and information campaign; Indicative budget for the implementation of the measure - BGN 50,000.

BG0089,Bulgaria,4,11,BGR,Europe,National,1,2022,2024,2,Civic participation,Improving the regime of volunteering in the Republic of Bulgaria,Improvement of Volunteering Regime,"What is the public problem being addressed by the measure? Since 2003, organizations that work with volunteers have been proposing to the state to adopt a Law on Volunteering - to have more clarity, guarantees and validation for volunteer work. 5 draft laws have been developed, submitted to 4 different National Assemblies, but such a law has not yet been adopted. The lack of government policy and responsibility on this topic leaves the efforts of civil organizations and self-initiated groups without support and appreciation for the help they give to the most needy in society, as well as for the activity of civil organizations in general, whose life force are the volunteers. Only 10% of the population in our country (data from an omnibus survey by Alpha Research for 2021) participated in volunteer initiatives. The lack of definition for the legal status of volunteers, the validation of skills acquired as a result of volunteer work, the obligations of the organizations and institutions working with them, related to the requirements for ensuring the health and life of workers in the relevant environment are some of the factors that influence negatively civic activity realized through volunteering. This, in the medium and long term, is reflected in a poorly developed culture of solidarity and participation in public life. 

What does the measure consist of? Encouraging volunteerism through appropriate legal regulation will lead to wider civic participation and activation of more citizens in dialog with institutions and joint decision-making. The following activities are foreseen in order to implement the measure: - making the Council for the Development of Civil Society a place to attract a wide range of civil organizations to discuss the subject of volunteerism; - identifying stakeholders and conducting a volunteering needs assessment; 41 - organizing discussion forums in order to create a framework for a possible future Law on Volunteering - creating a working group for the CDCS with the participation of stakeholders (institutions, civil organizations, business - with opinion and competence on volunteering). - Preparation of a preliminary assessment of the impact and a draft legislative framework of volunteering in Bulgaria - in an open process and a regime of constant public consultation, including, but not limited to: - Conducting various forms of public consultation with stakeholders during the preparation of the preliminary assessment and during the development of the draft of normative texts; - Organization of a public forum, in which representatives of interested persons from the entire spectrum of volunteer activity, and above all - volunteer organizations and representatives of the volunteers themselves, participate. - Preparation of an analysis of the legislative framework in the field of volunteering in several leading European countries and those with similar demographic and socio- economic characteristics. - Public consultation on the developed and agreed draft legislation with the preliminary impact assessment. - Submitting the draft legislation with the results of the public consultations to the National Assembly. Throughout this period of implementation, the stakeholders carry out activities related to the inclusion of national representatives to the idea and the specific draft law, in view of creating preparation for the subsequent discussions in the National Assembly and an attitude of support for its adoption. 

How will the implementation of the measure contribute to solving the problem? The development of draft legislative changes as a result of an open process with various forms of public consultation ensured at the various stages of project preparation will fulfill the mandatory conditions for the adoption of the proposed legal changes by the National Assembly at the next stage. During the preparation of the preliminary impact assessment, various options will be discussed for addressing the needs of specific legal incentives and rules in the field of volunteering, which will prepare the contents of the debate in the National Assembly in the adoption of the regulation. The open and inclusive process of developing the legislative changes will be a clear sign on the part of the state institutions that they want to develop an encouraging policy of voluntary activity in support of good governance in partnership with civil organizations and businesses. 

How does the measure relate to the values of the initiative? The regulation of public relations in the field of voluntary activity in the country with the aim of its promotion and sustainable development is necessary to achieve wider civic participation. The majority of civil organizations are made from volunteers and/or involve volunteers in their activities to varying degrees. Civil organizations are among the most active representatives of civil society, which are engaged in activities as required by the institutions of public information and its popularization among the general public, participation in various forms of consultation, dialog and partnership with state authorities. 

More information (including budget for implementation of the measure) Time and human resources are necessary for the preparation of the preliminary assessment of the impact, the respective analyses and public consultations during the development of the proposal for legal regulation.

Development of the process of examining consumer complaints with the purpose of promptly /within a reasonable period of time/ receiving advice for the protection of their rights and interests or resolving the dispute through negotiations with the relevant economic operator. The Consumer Protection Commission as an administrative body - an executive body, should not administer justice and, in connection with this, should not consider consumer complaints against traders when legal disputes arise between them, because they are civil disputes. The CPC should consider signals of violations of consumer legislation and impose the provided sanctions in the event of a proven violation, accept proposals for improving the organization and its activities, as well as give advice to consumers on how to protect their rights. Users submit numerous complaints to the CPC /about 20,000-25,000 per year/, which does not have the authority to resolve them, thus generating substantial public dissatisfaction, as well as blocking the Commission's activity and reducing the resources for carrying out the activities for 50 which in fact the commission has powers - control functions. If human and organizational resources are freed up by dropping complaints of little material interest, we believe that the CPC will increase its effectiveness many times over. 

What does the measure consist of? Development of a procedure for assigning the consideration of consumer complaints related to disputes with traders, and providing assistance in the resolution of disputes, in which the activities will be described, in order to test the possibility of their implementation by consumer protection associations /NGOs - consumer protection associations in Bulgaria, such as: Bulgarian National Association ""Active Consumers"", ""Association for Legal Assistance to Consumers"" - city ofPlovdiv and Federation of Consumers in Bulgaria/ . The purpose of the measure is to establish the effectiveness of the outsourcing of NGO complaint handling activities and impact assessment in the event of a possible future proposal to amend the consumer protection legislation /Law on Consumer Protection and Law on the Provision of Digital Content and Digital Services and for sale of goods/. 

How will the implementation of the measure contribute to solving the problem? Ensuring higher consumer satisfaction with the actions taken, as well as broadening the scope of consumer awareness regarding their expectations. 

How does the measure relate to the values of the initiative? The proposed measure is related to the principles of the initiative, including joint actions with the civil society /NGO/ in its planning and implementation and would have a transformative potential for the 51 functioning of the institution in terms of freeing up administrative resources. Also, the measure is concrete, with measurable results, executable within the national plan period and with certain financial parameters.

Competitiveness Unit
Cabo Verde has a high rate of unemployment and has experienced
relatively weak economic growth over the past decade. Moreover, its
public debt currently stands at 125% of GDP. A major priority of the
Government is to undertake critical reforms that lead to job creation,
economic growth, and social inclusion.
By 2027, Cabo Verde will have completed the necessary reforms and
structural changes to earn a top-50 ranking on the World Bank’s
Ease of Doing Business Index.
The far-reaching reforms will involve numerous public- and privatesector
actors, including several government ministries,
municipalities, chambers of commerce, micro-finance NGOs, ITCs,
and private business representatives.
These reforms will be coordinated by Competitiveness Unit, a new
inter-sectorial agency created by the Prime Minister in July 2018,
and reflect the Doing Business methodology recommended by the
World Bank. Support from the European Union, United Nations,
World Bank, and other international institutions will help fund the
reforms.
The Competitiveness Unit has developed a comprehensive action
plan and strategy for streamlining existing processes pertaining to
permits, licenses, regulations, clearances, approvals and
authorizations. The Unit will also strive to innovate by collaborating
with ITCs to digitize many business processes and procedures,
including e-signature, territorial demarcation, on-line tax payment,
and other essential transactions.
Pursuing this commitment will contribute to a more open society by
making it much easier for citizens to have access to credit, start a
business, commence construction, pay/document taxes, and access
an array of information and services online Why is the commitment
relevant to OGP values?
The commitment to increase the ease of doing business in Cabo
Verde will not only precipitate stronger economic growth but also
empower citizens to take private initiative. Equally important, the
reforms will add transparency to government processes, improve
public service, reduce costs for opening/operating a business, and
make options for self-service transactions and informational retrieval
more readily accessible.
The reforms reflected by this commitment follow naturally from
others undertaken over the past decade. In 2008, for example, a new
law aimed at expediting company creation went into effect.
Registration became relatively straightforward and the concept of
“business in one day” is increasingly the norm. Joint stock
companies (JSCs) and limited liability companies (LLCs) can be
established by any office of the Commercial Registry Department of
Casa do Cidadão.
In 2014, additional measures were approved to simplify the
procedures for the amendment of commercial companies and
introduce a single fee for their creation, alteration, or closure.
Only one business establishment procedure - obtaining a municipal
license - is now relatively burdensome for firms, as is requires an
inspection, takes eight days to process, and carries a significant fee
of CVE 30,000. Since 2009, however, this process can be finalized
following the start of operations, a practice in line with common
international standards.
At present, the Government is also looking to simplify the work of
notaries by creating a database of pre-approved company names that
could be used by new firms.
With the support of the World Bank, Cabo Verde has secured a €2M
budget from the European Union to fund this commitment.
The commitment is also consistent with Cabo Verde’s Strategic
Development Plan (PEDS).  Milestone activity with

CV0004,Cabo Verde,2,1,CPV,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2023,2025,2,Open Government based on open data,Establishment and approval of open data policy and develop Open Data,Establishment of Open Data Policy,"What is the issue addressed by the commitment? Both public and private institutions have a large amount of data that is not readily available to the public. Even with new commitments to facilitate greater transparency, a persistent lack of user - friendly data recovery technologies poses significant barr iers to accessibility. Furthermore, the absence of a common data platform excludes self - service and requires that each request be treated as an ad hoc occurrence that can only be met with a cumbersome and inherently inefficient response. 

What is the commitment? Establishing and approving the open data policy and develop the Open Data Portal 

How will the commitment help solve the issue identified? • Will expand access to data, producing considerable benefits to private citizens, businesses and public managers. • Will increase transparency and efficiency, creating the opportunity for self-service data recovery • Will improve access to open data and decision-making, expand public knowledge and stimulate innovation 

Why is the commitment relevant to OGP values? This commitment facilitates the data sharing expectations expressed by many public institutions, while encouraging civic interest and participation. In addition, an open data platform will allow more qualified observers (e.g., journalists, academics, etc.) to study relevant data patterns, inform citizens and shape public policy and action. 

Additional information The portal is currently under development 

Description of expected outcomes Improving governance, in particular transparency and quality and access to data for sector decision-making; Having all the conditions to publish, locate and exploit data in an open manner.

Access and orderly provision of the information collected, generated and maintained by the State is a key component to build on more informed and accurate governance strategies and public policies. But it also is an important added value for civil society and businesses that can take advantage of these data. The measures proposed in this area of intervention aim to open up the State, make it more transparent and scrutinized and, therefore, a more credible partner for the country's development. At the moment, information related to existing public services is dispersed. Part of the information can be found on the state services portal and the vast majority of the information is not mapped and is scattered across various government agencies, making it difficult for citizens, businesses and decision makers in the change process to access information. 

What is the commitment? Development of the computer platform that makes available the repository of information on public services provided to citizens and businesses. 

How will the commitment help solve the issue identified? This commitment solves the problem of accessing information on services provided by the State, ensuring that citizens find the information they need online, and that this same information is valid, up-to-date and of good quality. It will enable citizens and businesses to submit complaints, make recommendations for improvement regarding the provision of services, information on which is made available on the platform.

Why is the commitment relevant to OGP values ? • It enables to create knowledge of the services available (provided in person and digitally); • It allows knowledge of all citizens involved in public affairs, in particular public services; • It improves the quality of information made available which increases transparency. 

Additional information The project is included in Cabo Verde's Digital Government Action Plan 

Description of expected outcomes The expected result is the implementation and provision of a centralized public service information repository, capable of centrally feeding other government platforms, containing information on at least 80% of the public services provided.

The Access to Information Act maintains openness and transparency by serving the important public interest of enabling public debate on the conduct of government institutions, in turn strengthening the accountability of the Government of Canada to Canadians. In recent years, the need to update the Act has been noted during open government consultations and by the Information Commissioner as well as other stakeholders. It has not been significantly updated since 1983. How will it be done: In March 2016, the Government announced a two-step approach to revitalize access to information: (1) move forward in the near term on the Government’s commitments to improve the Access to Information Act, followed by (2) a full review of the Act, no later than 2018. The Government’s commitments to improve the Act in the near term include: - Making government data and information open by default, in formats that are modern and easy to use; - Eliminating all fees, except for the initial $5 filing fee; 11 - Providing requestors with a written explanation when information cannot be released; - Giving Government institutions and the Information Commissioner authority to decline to process requests that are frivolous or vexatious; - Giving the Information Commissioner the power to order the release of government information; - Ensuring that the Access to Information Act applies appropriately to the Prime Minister's and Ministers' Offices, as well as administrative institutions that support Parliament and the courts; - Undertaking a mandatory legislative review of the Access to Information Act every five years; and - Strengthening performance reporting on the Access to Information program. To make early progress on these commitments, on May 5, 2016 the Government of Canada issued an Interim Directive on the Administration of the Access to Information Act. The Directive sends a strong message across federal institutions that government information belongs to the people it serves and should be open by default. It emphasizes that government information should be available to the public, except in very limited and specific situations when it must be protected for reasons such as privacy, confidentiality, and security. The Directive also directs federal officials to: - waive all Access to Information fees apart from the $5 filing fee; and - release information in user-friendly formats (e.g. spreadsheets), whenever feasible.",NA,NA,Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat,Justice Canada and the Privy Council Office,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,ND,ND,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ND,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2018,ND,ND,Medium,2,Yes,1,1,0,0,1,Minor,1,Substantial,4,0,0,ND,ND,ND,ND,2019,Substantial,4,No Change,0,ND,ND,Marginal,2,Marginal,3,Marginal,3,Not Applicable,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,2,4,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,2,PotImp,https://opengovpartnership.org/members/canada/commitments/ca0042,2019,0,AP_CAN03,544

Issue to be addressed
Concealing information about corporate ownership can facilitate:
• tax evasion
• money laundering
• terrorist financing
• human rights abuses
• corruption
By improving corporate transparency, governments can safeguard against the misuse of
corporations and other legal entities while continuing to facilitate the ease of doing business in
order to foster growth and innovation.
In Canada, the responsibility for corporate law is shared between federal, provincial, and
territorial governments. Additionally, international collaboration and information-sharing
where appropriate can support more effective work in this domain by identifying best practices
and common challenges. Coordination is therefore needed to address corporate issues
effectively.
Commitment
The Government of Canada will continue to work with provincial and territorial governments to
implement the federal, provincial, and territorial finance ministers’ December 2017 Agreement
to Strengthen Beneficial Ownership Transparency. We will:
• require federal corporations to hold beneficial ownership information
• engage with key stakeholders on possible options to improve timely access to beneficial
ownership information

Existe falta de control y seguimiento del marco jurídico vigente relacionado con acceso a la información, participación ciudadana y anticorrupción. En la actualidad no existe un esfuerzo sostenido por verificar la implementación y cumplimiento de normativa relacionada con prácticas de Gobierno Abierto. Así mismo, es necesario contar con indicadores de evaluación y monitoreo en función de los esfuerzos que se están realizando en temas de Gobierno Abierto, Justicia Abierta, Parlamento Abierto y Estado Abierto. Dichos esfuerzos se sustentan en procesos normativos cuya implementación es lenta o no se ha iniciado y que es necesaria para las acciones dirigidas al acceso a la información, participación ciudadana, transparencia, datos abiertos y anticorrupción, requiriendo su monitoreo y evaluación sostenida en el tiempo.
¿Cuál es el compromiso?
Establecimiento del Observatorio del marco jurídico de Gobierno Abierto para el monitoreo de la implementación de normas y acciones, así como la evaluación del impacto para el monitoreo ciudadano y el diseño de iniciativas de realimentación y mejora.
¿Cómo contribuirá a resolver la problemática?
El desarrollo de un mecanismo multicanal que permitirá verificar los procesos y su cumplimiento en función de metas institucionales definidas en la estrategia organizacional o sectorial. Además, brindaría procesos de realimentación que faciliten mejoras organizativas, de gestión y normativas.
Otras ventajas que brindaría un Observatorio es la promoción de una cultura en la población orientada a la utilización de las TIC del Sector Público, incremento en la participación digital y presencial, acceso a derechos por medios electrónicos, seguimiento a la implementación normativa, generación de capacidades de gestión en los servidores públicos, ejercicio de deberes y responsabilidades ciudadanas, entre otros.
Por tanto, se busca el fortalecimiento en las capacidades de la población por medio la participación presencial y digital en el monitoreo de la legislación relacionada con sus derechos y deberes en los ejes de Gobierno Abierto.
De igual forma se busca dar sostenibilidad a las normas que se han promovido en los procesos de Gobierno Abierto con el objetivo de que la herramienta sea un mecanismo de realimentación y control ciudadano para que las instituciones puedan hacer una mejora continua.
¿Por qué es relevante a los valores de OGP?
Transparencia y Acceso a la Información. Permite el monitoreo del proceso de implementación de normas priorizadas relacionadas con Gobierno Abierto de cara al ciudadano. Además, mejora las condiciones de acceso a la información para la generación de espacios de participación pública en la toma de decisiones y la colaboración, impactando en la sensibilización y facultad de ciudadanos y servidores públicos.
Rendición de cuentas. Iniciativa que por los mecanismos de implementación asegurará los espacios para que las instituciones se refieren a sus avances y pendientes en cuanto a normativa vigente en materia de apertura gubernamental y estatal.
Participación y Colaboración. El compromiso facilita el espacio de realimentación desde las contrapartes para mejorar los procesos de gestión pública y organización, en miras al cumplimiento de normativa en materia de gobierno abierto.

CR0061,Costa Rica,4,3,CRI,Americas,National,1,2019,2022,3,Decarbonization,"GEOexplora+i para transparentar la información de ordenamiento territorial, apoyar la toma de decisiones y potenciar el involucramiento ciudadano",GEOexplora+i Platform,"¿Cuál es el problema público que abordará el compromiso?

 Costa Rica y el mundo se enfrentan a una crisis climática provocada por el calentamiento global que amenaza con alterar irremediablemente las condiciones de vida en nuestro planeta. En Costa Rica se estima en un 2,4% el crecimiento anual de las emisiones de gases de invernadero. Y si no se toman medidas mitigadoras, entre 2015 y 2030 estas emisiones crecerían en un 60% y podrían llegar a aumentar en un 132% en 2050. Entre las varias razones detrás de estos aumentos en emisiones se encuentran el uso desordenado y carente de planificación de los territorios y un modelo de ordenamiento que está orientado en función del vehículo privado y no de las personas. Esta situación responde a una falta histórica de integración multisectorial y multifactorial en la gestión del territorio y a un incumplimiento generalizado de las normativas existentes. Es así como únicamente 40 de los 82 cantones del país cuentan con un plan regulador (aunque en la mayoría sólo sea parcial), solo 21 cuentan con viabilidad ambiental de 50 la Secretaría Técnica Nacional (SETENA) y apenas 4 cuentan con matriz de vulnerabilidad hidrogeológica. Esta falta de un adecuado ordenamiento territorial ha generado degradación ambiental, la destrucción de ecosistemas, modelos insostenibles de movilidad y problemas asociados a la vulnerabilidad ante amenazas naturales provocadas por el cambio climático, cuyos costos de atención para el año 2015 se estiman en un 2,5% del PIB, según la Contraloría General de la República. Unido a esto, se ha detectado una dificultad de concientizar e involucrar a la ciudadanía en los procesos de ordenamiento territorial ya que la institucionalidad costarricense no tiene mecanismos oficiales para hacer efectiva la coordinación necesaria entre los diversos actores, los cuales también incluyen a la sociedad civil y al sector privado, para trabajar en pro de la solución a los problemas de ordenamiento territorial. Además, no hay una efectiva participación de la población en la toma de decisiones políticas sobre la planificación y el desarrollo urbano que sea bien informada y tenga incidencia. En respuesta a esta situación, el gobierno costarricense ha impulsado iniciativas ambiciosas como el Plan Nacional de Descarbonización 2018-2050, el cual tiene entre sus ejes la gestión del territorio rural, urbano y costero orientado a la conservación y el uso sostenible. También se encuentra la Política Nacional de Desarrollo Urbano 2018-2030, que se propone aumentar el conocimiento, participación e involucramiento de todas las personas en los temas clave del ordenamiento territorial, así como promover una planificación urbana inclusiva, resiliente y adaptable a nuevas circunstancias, que derive en un Plan Nacional de Desarrollo Urbano, planes reguladores, planes regionales y planes a otra escala subnacional que incorporen la variable ambiental y contemplen la mejora y adaptación paulatina de las infraestructuras a efecto de mitigar los riesgos y amenazas del cambio climático. El MIVAH, además, ha asumido el esfuerzo de crear GEOexplora+i el cual es una plataforma tecnológica, sustentada en un Centro de Información Geográfica, accesible al público a través de un geoportal que contiene información y datos georreferenciados e incluye visores sobre temáticas y proyectos vinculados al ordenamiento territorial y la planificación urbana en el país. 51 La publicación de información a través de GEOexplora+i tiene como objetivo facilitar el acceso a la información geoespacial oficial a usuarios no expertos y a la población costarricense en general, así como el de facilitar el intercambio de insumos y mejorar la articulación y coordinación entre instituciones, la cogestión territorial y social, la planificación y la programación presupuestaria en las áreas que las instituciones estatales consideren estratégicas y de prioridad, para apoyar la toma de decisiones basadas en datos para mejorar el ordenamiento del territorio y el desarrollo sostenible. Esta plataforma se encuentra en una versión beta que todavía no es accesible al público. 

¿Cuál es el compromiso? El compromiso busca fortalecer la recolección, integración y publicación de los datos sobre ordenamiento territorial y uso del territorio para así tomar decisiones más informadas desde la institucionalidad pública en términos de planificación territorial y generar soluciones innovadoras a problemas territoriales con base en esa información. Además, busca facilitar a la sociedad civil organizada un acceso más fácil a estos datos, con el fin de que se involucre activamente en las diferentes instancias participativas y de representación ciudadana que existen actualmente en torno a estos temas, para así posicionar el ordenamiento territorial como un tema prioritario en la agenda ciudadana y política del país a través del cual se pueden solucionar problemas relevantes e indirectamente alcanzar las metas de descarbonización detalladas en el Plan Nacional de Descarbonización. Con ese fin se plantean seis acciones principales: 

1. El desarrollo y lanzamiento de la versión final de GEOexplora+i, a partir de una evaluación de la versión beta con organizaciones de sociedad civil, instituciones públicas y actores clave para adecuar y realizar mejoras desde la perspectiva de los potenciales usuarios y público meta. 

2. Articulación con otras instituciones como: MOPT, MINAE, ICT, INVU, CNE, MJP, INDER, Ministerio de Salud, CCSS, MEP, MSP, Ministerio de Cultura, ICODER, AyA, IMAS, MICITT, IFAM, MIDEPLAN, IGN, 52 MAG, INEC y municipalidades, para integrar en la plataforma información específicamente relevante para el ordenamiento territorial que contribuye a la descarbonización y el cambio climático, como lo son datos de movilidad, flota vehicular, planes reguladores (urbanos y costeros), recuperación de infraestructura, emisión de gases, variables ambientales de planes reguladores, entre otros. 

3. Conformación de un Consejo Ciudadano de Ordenamiento Territorial, integrado por una comunidad de usuarios expertos de diferentes sectores con los que ya el MIVAH trabaja, que se encargue de evaluar periódicamente la información disponible en GEOexplora+i y genere recomendaciones sobre datos que se deban agregar, presentación y uso de la información existente y formas de mejorar la experiencia del usuario, entre otros. Este Consejo también apoyaría los esfuerzos por articular con otras instituciones que aún no hayan compartido información para ser integrada dentro de GEOexplora+i. 

4. Realización de talleres con la comunidad de usuarios expertos que estarán enfocados en potenciar el uso de los datos disponibles en GEOexplora+i para generar propuestas de solución a los problemas ligados con el ordenamiento territorial, la adaptación al cambio climático y la descarbonización. Estos talleres pueden tomar también la forma de foros, expediciones de datos y hackatones y, de ser posible, deben vincularse con las municipalidades que ya han sido identificadas como especialmente vulnerables a los efectos del cambio climático. 

5. Co-creación de una Guía de Participación Ciudadana para el Ordenamiento Territorial, que facilite y fortalezca el involucramiento ciudadano y explique claramente las potestades, responsabilidades, regulaciones y normativas existentes sobre el tema, la cual servirá para promover los espacios participativos formales ya existentes en el tema de ordenamiento territorial y movilidad. Para la promoción de estos espacios también se 53 aprovecharán el Consejo Ciudadano de Ordenamiento Territorial y los talleres con la comunidad de usuarios expertos previamente descritos, así como otros espacios de formación y capacitación que otras instituciones brindan. 

6. Aprovechamiento de los espacios de involucramiento ciudadano abiertos a partir de este compromiso para generar insumos y esfuerzos que contribuyan a la presentación y promoción ante la Asamblea Legislativa de una Ley de Ordenamiento Territorial. 

¿Cómo contribuirá el compromiso a solucionar el problema público? El compromiso contribuye a solucionar el problema ya que: 

1. Geoexplora+i permitirá a las diferentes instituciones del Estado tener una visión completa del territorio, tomar mejores decisiones y avanzar procesos más efectivos e informados en torno al ordenamiento territorial y la mitigación de las causas y los efectos del cambio climático. 

2. La información de GEOexplora+i podrá ser utilizada por la ciudadanía, organizaciones de sociedad civil y sector privado para generar proyectos y soluciones a los problemas de ordenamiento territorial a los que se enfrentan, particularmente en los territorios más afectados por el cambio climático o donde se generan más emisiones. 

3. Los mecanismos o espacios de participación en el tema de ordenamiento territorial en las diferentes instituciones serán impulsados, promocionados y acercados a la ciudadanía, para que estos mecanismos vuelvan a tener relevancia y la ciudadanía pueda tener incidencia directa en el ordenamiento territorial y temas afines. Además, se crearán nuevos espacios de participación para acompañar e incidir en las diferentes acciones que plantee la institucionalidad. GEOexplora+i se desarrollará como una plataforma para el intercambio de información geoespacial a nivel institucional, pero también como un visor informativo que fomenta la 54 transparencia y rendición de cuentas hacia el ciudadano, cumpliendo con los principios de Gobierno Abierto. Por lo anterior, la forma de medir su impacto va asociado a indicadores de producto tales como: Número de ciudadanos que accedan a GEOexplora+i para consulta de información. Número de ciudadanos que solicitan publicar información en GEOexplora+i, sea en materia de estudios o investigaciones. Número de ciudadanos que descargan información para sobreponerla con la información que tenga de referencia para un estudio o bien para un trabajo universitario, colegial o escolar. Número de instituciones gubernamentales que, como grupo de trabajo, acceden a GEOexplora+i para definir proyectos que cumplen con algunos de los 10 ejes de descarbonización. Número de municipalidades y grupos de consultores que, como grupo de trabajo, acceden a GEOexplora+i para elaborar su plan regulador. De igual manera, se puede hablar de indicadores de eficacia, relacionados al número de proyectos desarrollados u obras construidas que consideraron información de GEOexplora+i; así como los montos invertidos en ellos por unidad de tiempo determinada (anual o cada 4 años). 

¿Por qué este compromiso es relevante para los valores de OGP? El compromiso es relevante para la transparencia, ya que está integrando, publicando, haciendo accesible y visualizando nueva y mejor información geoespacial sobre la gestión y las condiciones del territorio. El compromiso es relevante para la participación cívica porque está impulsando las oportunidades de acceso a los espacios de participación, está fortaleciendo las capacidades y la formación de aquellas personas que desean participar en estos espacios y también está creando 55 nuevos espacios vinculados con la evaluación y el uso de los datos de GEOexplora+i. El compromiso es relevante para la rendición de cuentas ya que a través de la información que llegará a recibir el ciudadano, grupos organizados, gobiernos locales e instituciones públicas, todos los usuarios tendrán la posibilidad de referirse a la institución o sector correspondiente a fin de hacer valer su opinión respecto a la atención que recibe su cantón, distrito o zona de residencia; o bien ser fiscalizadores de los proyectos realizados en materia de ordenamiento territorial. 

Información adicional El compromiso está vinculado con el Plan Nacional de Descarbonización 2018-2050 y la Política Nacional de Desarrollo Urbano 2018-2030. El compromiso está vinculado con el Plan Nacional de Desarrollo e Inversión Pública 2019-2022, el cual tiene como una de sus metas nacionales la Descarbonización de la economía y tiene un área estratégica de “Infraestructura, Movilidad y Ordenamiento Territorial” El compromiso está vinculado con los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible N°13: “Adoptar medidas urgentes para combatir el cambio climático y sus efectos”, y N°15: “Proteger, restablecer y promover el uso sostenible de los ecosistemas terrestres, gestionar los bosques de forma sostenible, luchar contra la desertificación, detener e invertir la degradación de las tierras y poner freno a la pérdida de la diversidad biológica”.

of corruption and related offenses.",Whistleblower Protection,"Adopt and popularize a law on the protection of those reporting acts of corruption and related offenses. 15 January 2019 - 30 June 2020 Lead implementing agency/actor High Authority for Good Governance (HABG) Commitment description What is the public problem that the commitment will address? The lack of legal means to protect whistle blowers maintains the fear to denounce or participate in the fight against corruption. What is the commitment ? The High Authority for Good Governance undertakes to popularize the law related to the protection of whistle blowers after its adoption. The Commitment consists in : - making the law adopted; - informing the population on physical, psychological safety guarantees given by the State, if the population agrees to report acts of corruption and related offenses of which it is a victim or witness, - explaining specific arrangements for protecting whistle blowers, - getting the population to report acts of corruption and related offenses. These organizations shall be deployed in the field to continue the law outreach actions. How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? The implementation of this commitment should result in awareness of citizens about legal arrangements which protect them against retaliations, threats and intimidations from, corrupt actors. The more people feel themselves protected, the better they will participate in combating corruption. The whistle blowers and witnesses may declare the address of the police station, the brigade of gendarmerie, the High Authority for Good Governance to be their registered addresses. Whistle blowers and witnesses may report on a confidential basis.
Whistle blowers and witnesses as well as their relatives are
effectively protected.
This commitment will enable the population to be informed
on guarantees provided by law in terms of serenity, physical
or psychological integrity of persons or their properties and
possibly those of families or relatives of these persons, for a
cooperation without fear, likely to efficiently contribute to
the establishment of the truth.
Why is this commitment
relevant to OGP values?
This commitment improves and strengthens the fight against
corruption.
Likewise, it is relevant in terms of access to information and
citizen participation.

Persistence of corruption and related offenses in public management. In order to effectively fight corruption, Côte d'Ivoire has ratified and transposed the African Union Convention on the prevention and fight against corruption. This Convention requires States to create the conditions in order to proceed with the declaration of the assets of their senior officials. Despite the efforts made by the Ivorian State to apply this measure of the said Convention, we note the non-existence of declaration of assets during the exercise of the functions of the subject as provided for in the African Union Convention in its article 7.1. This commitment therefore aims to put an end to this state of affairs and thus improve the practice of declaring assets in the country. 

What is the commitment? The commitment consists in the revision of the law N° 2019-986 of November 27, 2019 ratifying the ordinance N° 2018-477 of May 16, 2018 amending article 94 of the ordinance N° 2013-660 of the 20 September 2013 relating to the prevention and the fight against corruption and similar offenses as amended by ordinances N° 2015-176 of March 24, 2015 and N° 2018-25 of January 17, 2018 in order to make mandatory the declaration of asset update during the term of office or function of persons subject to the declaration of assets. The main steps in the review process are: - Review of the texts on the declaration of assets of the comparator countries; - Preparation of draft ordinances and corrective decrees; - Validation of draft texts by the HABG; - Transmission of draft texts to the General Secretariat of the Government for adoption and follow-up. 22 

How will commitment contribute to solve the public problem? The declaration of assets while in office or function aims to improve transparency in the development of the assets of senior officials during their periods of activity. It can help fight corruption in two ways: - It has a preventive function because it establishes a permanent control of the patrimonial situation of the subjected persons; - It acts upstream of the repression because the analysis of the declarations of updating of assets can reveal in time relevant elements which could give rise to legal proceedings before the statute of limitations of the incriminated facts. 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? - This commitment is relevant for transparency insofar as it will allow the HABG to have up-to-date information on asset declarations instead of waiting for the end of mandates or functions before disposing of them. - The commitment is relevant for citizen participation because civil society can rely on regular data to guide its interventions in the fight against corruption in which it is a stakeholder; - Finally, this commitment is relevant with regard to public responsibility because the declaration of assets is above all a means of ensuring that senior figures with decision-making power or influence over the management of public resources do not benefit from it. to illegally increase their wealth. 

Additional information Through this commitment, the High Authority for Good Governance intends to produce a draft amending ordinance and the subsequent draft decree to be transmitted to the General Secretariat of the Government, which is responsible for its adoption. However, monitoring of the adoption process by the Government will be done in conjunction with the Ministry of Justice. The estimated budget for this commitment is 60 million CFA.

The coronavirus pandemic overnight forced employers and workers to lockdowns, restrictive measures, with their share of disadvantages on the results of companies and services, namely, increased vulnerability, reduction of normal hours of work and job losses. Teleworking appeared to be a way of working to cope with these constraints. Unfortunately, it is not provided for in the body of law in our country. Therefore, it appears necessary to provide for legislation on teleworking, so that it can fill the void and prevent possible new unforeseen cases and / or exceptional circumstances. 

What is the commitment? - Propose a draft ordinance instituting teleworking and supplementing the provisions of the Labor Code. - Propose a draft decree setting out the practical modalities for carrying out teleworking. In terms of results: Allow companies to face exceptional situations with the possibility of resorting to a more flexible mode of work organization. The commitment will consist of: - Transmit the proposed texts to the technical ministries involved; - Have the draft texts examined by the Tripartite Committee to Combat the Impact of Covid-19 on the World of Work - Have the draft texts examined by the Independent Permanent Consultative Commission (CIPC), a bipartite body of employers and workers; 25 - Consolidate and validate the texts in the Consultative Commission of Work (CCT), with a view to obtaining the final opinion of the social partners (employers and workers); - Transmit the draft texts to the General Secretariat of the Government. - Have the draft texts adopted by the National Assembly and the SENATE. 

How will commitment contribute to solve the public problem? These texts, once adopted, will ensure business continuity and preserve jobs. Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? Participation and inclusion: given the different committees that are consulted at each stage. Indeed, this commitment is also the result of the vision of the social partners (employers and workers) and of the Government.

The updating of the Environmental Code and its popularization respond to the need to enrich the old code of 1996 with new relevant provisions in the field of environment, in particular by taking into account the new environmental themes with a view to the adoption of an eco-citizen behavior of the populations.

Definition of the problem

2. What problem is the commitment intended to address? After the 1992 Rio Conference, Côte d'Ivoire adopted Law No. 96-766 of 3 October 1996 on the Environmental Code. The adoption of this law was reinforced by various special laws dealing with sectoral areas of the environment as well as their implementing decrees. But despite the significant progress made in building the legal framework for environmental protection, there are still weaknesses and gaps in the national legal framework. These relate to new environmental issues, including fight against climate change, the protection of biological diversity, the promotion of green economy and blue economy, the management of electrical waste and electronic equipment, the development of environmental taxation, the regulation of persistent organic products, the limitation of greenhouse gas emissions, the fight against coastal erosion, the involvement of local authorities, the private sector, associations for environmental protection

3. What are the causes of the problem? - Insufficiency and lack of knowledge of the regulatory and institutional framework; - Weak commitment of the populations, the communities, the social actors and the companies in an approach of sustainable development; - Lack of knowledge of new environmental issues such as climate change, biodiversity, coastal erosion; - Loss of biodiversity due to strong anthropic pressure (deforestation, poaching, infiltration in parks and reserves); - Pollution of marine and lagoon ecosystems; - Degradation of coastal resources and ecosystems.

Description of the commitment

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? - Adoption of the new Environment and Sustainable Development Code of 28 September 2022; - Mass sensitization during institutional events of the Ministry in charge of Environment (MINEDD); - Sensitization and education on the environment and sustainable development for the populations of National Parks and Natural Reserves; - Capacity building of local committees for participatory management of classified forests; - Support for the development of communities living in protected areas; - Creation of five (5) priority programs covering the following areas • Climate change mitigation and adaptation; • natural resource management; • coastal management; • forest cover management; • chemical management.

1. What solution do you suggest? It is necessary to update the implementation framework of the Environmental Preservation and Sustainable Development Promotion by taking into account the new environmental themes and carry out a mass sensitization for a change of behavior of populations.

2. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? The aim is to sensitize the population of communities, social actors and businesses about sustainable production and consumption patterns with a view to changing their behavior and becoming eco-citizens.

Commitment analysis

How will commitment promote transparency? The Environmental Code reinforces the systematization of the Environmental Impact Assessment of any project before its implementation. This makes it possible to take into account the impact on the population.

How will commitment help foster accountability? The Environmental Code systematically reinforces the Environmental Impact Assessment of any project before its implementation with the involvement of the populations from the beginning to the end of the environmental assessment, all things that allow to take into account the impact on the populations.

How will engagement improve citizen participation in defining, implementing and monitoring solutions? The Environmental Code puts the population at the center through the recognition of environmental protection associations. It also strengthens the accountability of Environmental Impact Assessments to the public. The new environmental code aims to take into account in the national legal order the new ecological challenges, in particular the fight against climate change and the involvement of local authorities, the private sector and environmental protection associations.

To adopt, as of 2023, the texts of labor law, to popularize them, and to make them accessible, then to sensitize the social partners on their existence and their applicability so as to reduce the conflicts and their consequences, due to the ignorance or the misunderstanding of these texts.

Definition of the problem

8. What problem is the commitment intended to address? The commitment aims to have a notable and permanent influence on the number of individual and collective conflicts in the contractual relationship in companies, or outside, due to the lack of knowledge, ignorance or inapplicability of the texts by the social partners in particular, and any user (other ministries, trainees, researchers, national and international organizations). The commitment also aims to further increase interaction between users and the Labor Inspectorate. In terms of annual statistics of dismissals for the year 2021, we have 11,831 individual conflicts and 268 cases of collective conflicts.

9. What are the causes of the problem? - Ignorance of existing labor law texts; - their non-application in companies by some employers; - the lack of training of employers and workers on their rights and duties in companies, sources of conflicts generating ruptures in the contractual relationship; - the”non-taking”; of all the application texts of the law n°2015-532 of July 20, 2015 on the Labor Code.

Description of the commitment

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? - Establishment of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue mechanisms (the National Council for Social Dialogue (CNDS), the Permanent Independent Consultation Commission (CIPC), the Labor Advisory Commission (CCT), the Tripartite Advisory Committee on International Labor Standards (CCTNIT), whose work leading to the drafting of texts necessarily requires the opinions and observations of employers and workers; - development and ongoing revision of the various Labor Codes (1995 and 2015 and 2021 ordinance); - adoption of the texts implementing the Labor Code from 2015 to 2022 (12/53 decrees in total) - preparation and adoption by the Council of Ministers of the decree on the minimum wage; - development and issuance of the order for the application of the minimum wage scale; - preparation and issuance of the decree on the revaluation of transport premiums for workers in the private sector; - adoption of the texts framing the Social Security system (National Social Security Fund, Universal Health Coverage, Social Regime for the Self-Employed) The success rate of these actions is 65%.

1. What solution do you suggest? - Accelerate the adoption of the remaining implementing legislation from January 2023 onwards: the objective is to achieve a 100% adoption rate by the end of June 2024; - strengthen awareness among social partners; - continue the information and the sensitization of the social partners, the civil society and the populations on the importance of the respect of texts which govern the professional relation, so that the commitment arouses more enthusiasm as well at the level of the public and private Administrations, as at the level of workers, employers for the effective appropriation of the texts; - transmit the texts to the social partners. These solutions will help to improve the professional relationship, reduce the number of conflicts and accidents at work and provide better social security for the worker.

 Implementation of the measure is under way until December 2018
 Leader of the measure MINISTRY OF JUSTICE
 Description of the measure
 Which public issue does the measure address? A law must be passed to protect persons who report instances of corruption,
 since the current model for protecting whistle-blowers is restricted to court
 protection, or rather the relevant provisions are found in various laws, and
 are restricted to protection in the sense of launching court proceedings for
 reprisals which the whistle-blower has suffered at their place of work. An
 analysis conducted by the Ministry of Justice has shown that it is necessary
 to assure anonymity in order to encourage potential whistle-blowers to report
 potentially illegal acts.
 What does the measure include? The measure requires the establishment of working groups to draft the Act,
 the production of the draft Act, and its adoption. The new Act must ensure
 the construction of an institutional framework for reporting irregularities
 efficiently and swiftly, and the effective legal protection of those who report
 them. It must also improve the potential for exposing those guilty of criminal
 acts of corruption, and raise the level of transparency, ethics and integrity in
 society as a whole.
 How does the measure contribute to resolving the
 public issue?
 The adoption of the Act should prescribe the formation of a system which
 will enable potential complainants to report effectively on irregularities and
 provide adequate protection for their integrity, with the aim of raising public
 awareness among employees and citizens of the need to report illegal and
 corrupt behaviour, and improve the accountability and transparency of the
 work of the public sector in general. 
 45
 Why is this measure relevant to the values of the
 Open Government Partnership?
 The measure is relevant to transparency because it contributes to publishing
 information and improves public access to information, since whistle-blowers
 provide the public with information which is in the public interest. Indirectly,
 the measure is relevant to public accountability, because it improves the
 rules and mechanisms relating to whistle-blowers, and thus holds civil
 servants and officials accountable for their actions.
 Additional information No extra resources are needed for the implementation of the measure.
 The measure is in accordance with the following documents:
 - Action Plan for 2017 and 2018, accompanying the Anti-Corruption
 Strategy 2015-2020
 - The Anti-Corruption Strategy 2015-2020

 Implementation of the measure began on 1 April 2018 and will last until 30 August 2020
 Leader of the measure MINISTRY OF CULTURE
 Description of the measure
 Which public issue does the measure address? The recession which began in 2008 had a negative effect on all types of
 media in Croatia. As a result of reduced revenues from advertising,
 between 2010 and 2015 the number of journalists fell, and many media
 houses ceased to operate. The development of technology and
 convergences, access to broadband internet and the invasion of
 smartphones radically changed the media ecosystem. The boundary
 between electronic and printed media became blurred, as both now had
 extensions via many non-linear services. On the Croatia media market, we
 need to bear in mind that regulation and support must include all media:
 public, commercial (electronic and print) and non-profit. The sustainability
 of media products with contents of public interest must be the obligation of
 all participants, while of course the public and non-profit media have a
 special role. Foreign entertainment media contents dominate all platforms,
 whether linear or non-linear, so that domestic products and the European
 parts would barely be able to survive on the competitive global market
 were it not for envisaged quotas. As part of talks on the revision of the
 AVMS Directive, there has been much discussion of how the quota system
 and option of gathering resources for producing and distributing European
 AV and encouraging media pluralism can be assured, through a regime of
 regulating non-linear platforms and services.
 In Croatia, the enforcement of the Media Act has not been assured, which
 has had a largely negative effect on respecting journalism ethics and
 standards in general (the pressure of the market economy). Today, there
 is increasing talk of 'fake news' and the lack of editorial accountability,
 particularly on all non-linear platforms. Croatia is one of only a few
 countries which does not have a regulatory body for print or some form of
 Press Council. 
 51
 It is necessary to strengthen co-regulation and self-regulation as models
 which contribute in a significant way to restoring damaged professional
 journalism standards and raising awareness of the phenomenon of 'fake
 news'. In this context, the issue of public trust in the media is very
 important, along with the issue of developing media literacy in
 particularly. Protecting minors and fighting hate speech are special
 challenges in regulating non-linear services.
 In media legislation and the production of support models, it is necessary
 to define potential non-profit media service providers. The key term of
 reference used to define non-profit media/public service providers should
 not be reduced to mere registration of the founder, but should primarily
 concern the provision of content of particular public interest. This kind of
 definition would on the whole answer the real need to increase the
 number of non-profit media, and would make it easier to bring some
 electronic media closer to the concept of a 'media community', which still
 needs to be worked out in detail.
 What does the measure include? The implementation of the measure will guarantee a new normative
 framework to enable a more functional system for working in the new
 digital environment, and assure more transparent work, protection of
 journalists, and access to support resources.
 The establishment of working groups is needed to produce the draft
 Electronic Media Act, Media Act, and an in-depth analysis, including, if
 necessary, amendments to the Croatian Radio and Television Act and the
 Croatian News Agency Act.
 All stakeholders to whom the provisions of these Acts apply will participate
 in the working groups, from non-profit media service providers to state
 administration bodies, and when the draft document is ready, consultations
 will be held with the interested public.
 How does the measure contribute to resolving the public
 issue?
 Amendments to the normative framework will facilitate the work of the
 media in the new conditions of the digital society, the publication of
 information on the proprietors of all media to the level of physical
 persons, the publication of relevant information linked to the work of the
 media, and the further development of media literacy. 
 52
 Why is this measure relevant to the values of the Open
 Government Partnership?
 The measure is relevant to the more transparent, more efficient work of
 the media.
 Additional information Resources are guaranteed in the State Budget, section Ministry of
 Culture P3901, A564000 – within the regular work of the Ministry of
 Culture.

The boundary between electronic and printed media became blurred, as both now had extensions via many non-linear services. On the Croatian media market, we need to bear in mind that regulation and support must include all media: public, commercial (electronic and print), and non-profit. The sustainability of media products with contents of public interest must be the obligation of all participants, while of course the public and non-profit media have a special role. Foreign entertainment media contents dominate all platforms, whether linear or non-linear, so that domestic products and the European parts would barely be able to survive on the competitive global market were it not for envisaged quotas. As part of talks on the revision of the AVMS Directive, there has been much discussion of how the quota system and option of gathering resources for producing and distributing European AV and encouraging media pluralism can be assured, through a regime of regulating non- linear platforms and services. In Croatia, the enforcement of the Media Act has not been assured, which has had a largely negative effect on respecting journalism ethics and standards in general (the pressure of the market economy). Today, there is increasing talk of 'fake news' and the lack of editorial accountability, particularly on all non-linear platforms. Croatia is one of only a few countries which do not have a regulatory body for print or some form of Press Council. Ensuring systematic financing for non-profit media contributes to the fight against the spread of ""fake news"" and to the truthful and balanced information of citizens about political and social issues, so that they can competently make the best decisions in accordance with their own interests. It is necessary to strengthen co-regulation and self-regulation as models which contribute in a significant way to restoring damaged professional journalism standards and raising awareness of the phenomenon of ""fake news"". In this context, the issue of public trust in the media is very important, along with the issue of developing media literacy in particular. Protecting minors and fighting hate speech are special challenges in regulating non-linear services. In the Republic of Croatia, the problem related to transparency is the issue of media ownership structures and it is often pointed out that they are hidden even though we have no concrete evidence of this. 

What does the measure include? The implementation of the measure will guarantee a new normative framework to enable a more functional system for working in the new digital environment and assure more transparent publication of ownership structures and the sources of financing. The establishment of working groups is needed to produce the draft Media Act, and in-depth analysis, including, if necessary, amendments to the Croatian Radio and Television Act and the Croatian News Agency Act. All stakeholders to whom the provisions of these Acts apply will participate in the working groups, from non-profit media service providers to state administration bodies, and when the draft document is ready, consultations will be held with the interested public. 

How does the measure contribute to resolving the public issue? Amendments to the normative framework will facilitate the work of the media in the new conditions of the digital society, the publication of information on the proprietors of all media to the level of natural persons, the publication of relevant information linked to the work of the media, the further development of media literacy, and the establishment of the fact-checking system. 

Why is this measure relevant to the values of the Open Government Partnership? The measure is relevant for a more transparent, more efficient work of the media.

HR0051,Croatia,4,11,HRV,Europe,National,1,2022,2024,2,Fight Against Corruption,Protection of Reporters of Irregularities,Protection of Reporters of Irregularities/Whistleblowers,"Which public issue does the measure address? Act on the Protection of Reporters of Irregularities (OG 17/19) entered into force on 1 July 2019. Until then, the Republic of Croatia did not have a uniform law that would regulate the protection of ""whistle-blowers"". The Act is modern and the Act on the Protection of Reporters of Irregularities has combined all legal standards for the protection of reporters irregularities, i.e. ""whistle-blowers"" in one specific law (lex specialis), which lays down general provisions, the rights of the reporters of irregularities, the procedure of reporting irregularities and acting upon reporting, judicial protection of reporters of irregularities and criminal provisions, with the aim of ensuring accessible and reliable ways of reporting irregularities, protecting reporters from harmful acts and promoting the prevention of irregularities by raising awareness of the necessity of safe reporting of irregularities. International standards for the protection of ""whistle-blowers"" were also taken into account during its development, particularly the Recommendation CM / Rec (2014) 7 of the Council of Europe on the protection of whistle-blowers. The Act on the Protection of Reporters of Irregularities regulates reporting of irregularities, the procedure of reporting irregularities, the rights of reporters of irregularities, the obligations of public authorities and legal and natural persons regarding the reporting irregularities, as well as other issues relevant for reporting irregularities and the reporters of irregularities (whistle-blowers). Following the adoption of this Act, further strengthening of the normative framework in the field of protection of reporters of irregularities is in the process. The Act is being drafted primarily due to the need for harmonisation of Croatian legislation with Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law. L 305/17 (hereinafter: Directive) 

What does the measure include? The Directive was adopted on 23 October 2019 and entered into force on 16 December 2019. The deadline for transposing the Directive and harmonising the legislation of the Member States is 17 December 2021. Therefore, the need to adopt a new Act on the Protection of Reporters of Irregularities refers to the need to harmonise the provisions of the Act on the Protection of Reporters of Irregularities with the Directive and harmonisation of Croatian legislation. In addition, the measure includes the implementation of the training of confidants on the application of the Act in general and their obligations in its application, trainings of judicial officials and providers of free legal aid, and possibly shop-stewards who can play a very active role in informing reporters about the protection of their rights and the employees themselves, or potential reporters about the need to report irregularities, ways in which they can do so in safe and ways laid down by law, and the protection they enjoy in doing so. 

How does the measure contribute to resolving the public issue? The new Act on the Protection of Reporters of Irregularities will further improve the system of reporting irregularities and protection of reporters. 

Why is this measure relevant to the values of the Open Government Partnership? The measure is relevant to transparency because it contributes to publishing information and improves public access to information, since the reporters of irregularities (""whistle-blowers"") provide the public with information which is in the public interest. Indirectly, the measure is relevant to public accountability, because it improves the rules and mechanisms relating to reporters of irregularities and the implementation of trainings for judicial officials, trusted persons, shop-stewards, providers of free legal aid and employees in the context of protection of reporters of irregularities.

HR0052,Croatia,4,12,HRV,Europe,National,1,2022,2024,2,Fight Against Corruption,Improving the Normative Framework for Preventing Corruption,Improving Frameworks for Preventing Corruption,"Which public issue does the measure address? In order to continue the continuous strategic implementation and building up the system of anti-corruption measures in the Republic of Croatia, after the period of validity of the current Anti-Corruption Strategy 2015-2020 (OG 26/15), a new Anti-Corruption Strategy 2021-2030 was adopted in October 2021. Corruption as a social phenomenon is conditioned by awareness of social values and acceptable behaviour and has a powerful effect on the rule of law and trust in institutions. Such climate also undeniably affects the economic prosperity and prosperity of all citizens. Therefore, the activities aimed at fighting corruption at all levels are a priority for the state and society as a whole. The effective fight against corruption therefore involves not only state bodies, independent institutions and justice, but also the whole of society, the business community, citizens and the civil sector as well as the international community. Despite the recognised existence of the necessary framework for the effective fight against corruption in the public sector and the networking of state bodies, which contributes to the formulation of anti-corruption policies in all branches of government, there is room and need for further improvements in the legislative and institutional framework for the fight against corruption. The strategy sets priorities in strengthening preventive mechanisms to combat corruption, through strengthening the institutional and legislative framework for combating corruption, strengthening the transparency and openness of public authorities, improving the integrity system and conflict of interest management in public administration. In addition, the Strategy will focus on strengthening the anti-corruption potentials in the public procurement system as a special priority area, and on raising awareness about the harmful effects of corruption and the necessity of effectively combating and preventing it. 

What does the measure include? The measure includes improving the legislative framework in certain areas of preventing corruption and adopting the first implementation document in the new strategic framework. A legal framework in the field of lobbying is currently being developed. Regulating lobbying as a legal and legitimate practice according to the highest ethical standards is planned, ensuring transparency in the work of lobbyists and a positive impact on the quality of regulations and decisions adopted by the legislative and executive branches of government. In addition, the adoption of the first triannual Action Plan or the period 2022-2024 for the implementation of the Strategy for 2021-2030 is planned. The Action Plan will contain specific activities for effective corruption risk management within the framework of previously strategically defined specific objectives and measures in individual sectoral priority areas. With each planned activity, setting the competent authorities for implementation, clearly indicating the implementation deadlines, necessary financial resources and the indicators of the results of the implementation of the activities within each individual measure will be necessary. 

How does the measure contribute to resolving the public issue? In addition to the continuous implementation and building up the existing anti-corruption measures, the new strategic framework aims to strengthen existing and create new systematic solutions for preventing corruptions at all levels, which needs to raise awareness of the harmful effects of corruption and make it socially unacceptable. Furthermore, the new strategic framework insists on a stronger affirmation of the role of citizens, civil society and the media as indispensable partners for public authorities in the uncompromising fight against corruption and in monitoring its effectiveness. Involving citizens, the media and civil society as ""a view from outside"" in detecting and monitoring the corruption risks of public policies helps public authorities in working more responsibly, transparently and to adequately influence the reduction of the possibility of corruption. 

Why is this measure relevant to the values of the Open Government Partnership? The measure is relevant for the fight against corruption because it contributes to the recognition and prevention of corruption as a socially unacceptable phenomenon. The measure is also relevant because it allows for the continuous implementation and building up of existing anti-corruption mechanisms and the strengthening of existing and creating new systematic solutions to prevent corruption. It also raises awareness of the harmful effects and social unacceptability of corruption. Furthermore, this measure contributes to a stronger affirmation of the role of citizens, civil society and the media as indispensable partners for public authorities in the uncompromising fight against corruption and in monitoring its effectiveness.

This Act must guarantee full depoliticisation and well-functioning of public administration, give a clear definition of criteria for appointment and remuneration of public employees, lay down conditions for career advancement and guarantee a high level of education of the officials. In the sphere of public administration this task continue to be crucial, as adoption of the act on public-law basis should ensure a clear definition of basic rights and duties of a civil servant, set principles of personal and managerial running of state administration and reduce a corruption risk of its employees. Depoliticisation of state administration shall be achieved through transparent selection procedures both for low-rank posts and for posts of leading employees (superiors), objective rules for awarding non-entitled components of wages (extra pay for leadership and bonuses) and professionalisation shall be guaranteed by effective human resources processes – system education, examinations of officers and personal work with employees. By a clear definition of employees’ rights and obligations, their development and simultaneously by professional stability even the efficiency of state administration execution will be increased. The requirement to fill the vacancies (“hiring state employees and officials of municipal and regional offices”) on the basis of a selection procedure (open competition), particularly on all levels of public administration, follows beside others from GRECO Recommendation from the 2nd Evaluation Round of 2006, which has not been fulfilled up to now.

MAIN OBJECTIVE Create conditions for maximizing the society-wide benefit of volunteering. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF COMMITMENT At both the legislative and non-legislative level, the aim is to create conditions to further support and develop volunteering in the Czech Republic. The new Act on Volunteering and its Support will regulate the conditions for all types of volunteering and the support will apply to voluntary organizations and volunteers in and outside the accredited regime. The new concept of development of volunteering will focus especially on practical support and development of volunteering in the Czech Republic and will be based on the summary of foreign and domestic experience and good practice examples. It will also contain recommendations for voluntary organizations and volunteer centres when working with volunteers.",7/1/2016,6/30/2018,Ministry of the Interior,Non-profit organizations,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,ND,ND,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ND,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2018,ND,ND,Medium,2,Yes,0,0,0,0,0,Minor,1,Limited,3,0,0,ND,ND,ND,ND,2019,Limited,3,No Change,0,ND,ND,Did Not Change,1,Did Not Change,2,Did Not Change,2,Did Not Change,2,0,0,1,1,1,9/9/2019,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,Rel,https://opengovpartnership.org/members/czech-republic/commitments/cz0020,2019,0,AP_CZE03,861
CZ0031,Czech Republic,5,2,CZE,Europe,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Raising awareness of the issue of whistle-blowers on illegal activity,Adopt and promote whistleblower protection legislation,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Society has a distorted (negative) perception of whistleblowers, which does not reflect their real contribution to detecting illegal acts and preventing other illegal situations. Whistleblowers are often exposed to retaliation and condemnation by society. This situation results in a reduced incentive for potential whistleblowers to report violations of law in the public interest. 

What is the commitment? The commitment consists of legislative, educational and media activities aimed at improving the social perception of whistleblowers. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? The adoption of the Act on the Protection of Whistleblowers will implement Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law. The bill also proposes establishment of the Agency for the Protection of Whistleblowers, which will, among other things, be responsible for collecting and publishing data on whistleblowing, provide expert advice in this area and raise general awareness of the issue. The adoption of the bill will be accompanied by a media campaign with the aim to correct the notion of whistleblowing and specify which scope of offences the Whistleblowers Protection Act will apply to. The project entitled ""Intensifying the fight against corruption by raising public sector awareness with focus on judges, law enforcement agencies and public administration"", which is part of the Good Governance programme, will address the issue of whistleblowers’ protection: a) media campaign including preparation of a brochure, b) international conference for experts, c) comparative study to share good practice abroad, d) statistical monitoring of reports of cases raised by whistleblowers, and e) training of experts (public prosecutors, judges). 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? Transparency: Increasing the motivation of potential whistleblowers (or reducing their hesitation) as a result of increasing awareness of whistleblowing issues in Czech society should lead to increased fight against illegal activities (including corruption), about which society will be informed Page 12 (of 24) through the media and the website korupce.cz. Civic participation: The increase in the initiative of whistleblowers is aimed at increasing the level of civic participation in public affairs as a result of the adoption of the Whistleblowers Protection Act and as a result of raising awareness of issues in society. Whistleblowers will be more motivated to detect wrongdoings of their employers and will be entitled to publish information about the breach if the conditions set by law are met. Public accountability: Raising awareness of whistleblowing aims, among other things, at combating infringements by civil servants and introduces the ""system of control"" by public employees. Corruption practices with a negative impact on society as a whole should thus be more easily detected and prosecuted. 

Additional information  The objectives of whistleblowers’ protection are part of the Government Anti-Corruption Conception for 2018 to 2022.  The commitment contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goal 16 through its Target 16.5 Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all forms. In terms of overlap with other sustainable development goals, whistleblower protection is one of the key areas, similar to environmental protection. Increasing the detection of infringements in this area is thus one of the objectives of the whistleblowers protection agenda.  The creation of comprehensive and effective legal regulations of whistleblowing also corresponds to the recommendations of the ODIHR or of the OECD Working Group on Bribery.

CZ0036,Czech Republic,6,2,CZE,Europe,National,1,2022,2024,2,NA,"Improving the status of whistleblowers, including raising awareness of whistleblowing",Adopt Legislation on Whistleblower Protections,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

The commitment consists in legislative, educational, and awareness-raising activities, the aim of which is to improve the legal and social status of whistleblowers, including increasing public awareness of whistleblowing as such.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? The Czech Republic does not yet have a comprehensive legal framework for whistleblowing. Potential whistleblowers (persons who report their knowledge on any wrongdoing) are currently not sufficiently protected against the retaliatory measures that often fall upon them after they reported the wrongdoing. At the same time, confidential and trustworthy reporting channels for whistleblowing are not set up by law, except for service authorities. There is also a distorted (negative) perception of whistleblowers in society that does not reflect their personal courage and real contribution to the detection of unlawful behaviour and the prevention or correction of infringements. On the contrary, whistleblowers are often subject to social condemnation and misunderstanding. This situation results in a reduced incentive for potential whistleblowers to report wrongdoing, the suppression of which is in the public interest. At the same time, the early detection of criminal or other unlawful activities based on the submitted reports is one of the necessary elements, which can bring about savings of public funds, averting a common threat or protecting people's lives and health.

2. What are the causes of the problem? The reasons for the above stigmatisation of whistleblowers can be seen both in the lack of legislation and in the societal attitude towards whistleblowers. The absence of legally enshrined secure reporting channels guaranteeing potential whistleblowers the protection of their identity, apart from Act No. 234/2014 Coll., on the Civil Service, and the relevant implementing provisions, is only one of the problems. Whistleblowers are not protected from retaliation, namely from employers, which may have a major impact on their professional and personal lives. Insufficient legal protection also sends a signal to society that the protection of whistleblowers is not a priority, which is further worsening their position. The negative perception of whistleblowers by a significant part of society is the result of a combination of factors. The historical experience in the Czech Republic with informers during totalitarian regimes during the 20th century is obvious. The change in public perception of whistleblowers has been very slow since 1989. This is, among other things, due to a lack of awareness, which is largely addressed only by the non-profit sector. 

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? There is no specific provision for the protection of whistleblowers enshrined in Czech legislation, except for the protection of whistleblowers from the ranks of civil servants according to Government Regulation No. 145/2015 Coll., on Measures Related to the Reporting of Suspected Infringements in a Public Offce. Whistleblowers are protected in criminal matters by general institutes of legal regulations against unlawful retaliation by the persons against whom the report was directed or by other persons who suffered damage as a result of the report. A whistleblower is protected from certain retaliatory measures within the framework of the employment or service relationship, namely by the contents of the regulations governing the relevant legal relationship. All these legal regulations contain legislation in the field of employment or service relationship that significantly limits the discretion of the employer and protects the employee. However, the measures mentioned above do not provide whistleblowers with sufficiently credible, confidential, and accessible channels through which the report can be made to the employer or an external authority, nor do they provide specialised advisory or legal support that a whistleblower often needs prior to submitting a report. As part of the fulfilment of the previous commitment enshrined in the Fifth Action Plan, the draft law on the protection of whistleblowers and the related amending law, aimed at implementing Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law (the ""Directive""), was prepared by the Ministry of Justice, approved by the Government and debated at first reading by the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic. However, with the end of the parliamentary term, the debate on the draft laws was not completed and the draft laws will have to go through the legislative process again. As of 17 December 2021, the Ministry of Justice, in relation to the direct vertical effect of the Directive not yet transposed, established an external reporting channel and a website containing relevant information on whistleblower protection under the Directive at its request at the address oznamovatel.justice.cz. The Ministry of Justice is also carrying out intensive methodological work, producing background material and actively communicating with entities at both the state and local level in relation to their obligation under the Directive to implement an internal reporting system. At the time the Sixth Action Plan was being drawn up and discussed, the interdepartmental comment procedure was conducting on the draft laws re-submitted by the Ministry of Justice and only partially modified, and afterwards, the settlement of the submitted comments. In cooperation with a media expert consultant, documents were also prepared for the tender documentation for the public procurement relating to ensure a media campaign and the necessary public contracts were administered under the project ""Intensification of the fight against corruption by raising awareness of the public sector with a focus on judges, law enforcement authorities, and public administration"". Details of the fulfilment of the previous commitment of the Fifth Action Plan have been published quarterly on the Commitment Card at https://korupce.cz/partnerstvi-pro- otevrene-vladnuti-ogp/narodni-akcni-plany-nap/paty-akcni-plan-2020-2022/faze- implementace/zavazek-4-2-zvyseni-povedomi-o-problematice-oznamovatelu-protipravniho- jednani/. 

2. What solution do you propose? The adoption of the Act on the Protection of Whistleblowers will, in addition to the implementation of the Directive, lead to the adoption of the first comprehensive legal regulation of the rules for reporting, the protection of whistleblowers, and the obligations of entities in the public and private sectors in the Czech Republic. The fact that the legislation on the protection of whistleblowers is based on the Directive will then send a clear signal to society that whistleblower protection is a priority at European Union level as well. The adoption of whistleblower protection rules emphasises their societal importance and, conversely, affects behaviour which is prejudicial to them as a result of reporting. In relation to awareness-raising, the draft law under consideration sets assignments, inter alia, for the Ministry of Justice to collect and publish data on whistleblowing issues or to provide expert advice in this area. The Ministry of Justice will also continuously raise awareness of the status and social contribution of whistleblowers as part of its work. The discussion and adoption of the proposed legislation will be synergistically accompanied by the implementation of the project ""Intensifying the fight against corruption by raising public sector awareness with focus on judges, law enforcement agencies and public administration"", which is part of the Good Governance Programme. The project includes the following range ofactivities of an educational and informative nature aimed mainly at improving the social perception of whistleblowers: a) creation of a comparative study to share good practice abroad, publication of this study on the website korupce.cz, b) media campaign aimed at promoting whistleblowing, c) international conference on whistleblower protection, d) a series of workshops and trainings for justice and public administration workers focused on the issue of whistleblowing and protection of whistleblowers, creation of an e-learning course, e) ongoing publicity includes, among other things, informing about partial outputs of the project in the form of press releases and publication on the website of the Ministry of Justice (justice.cz, korupce.cz), f) statistical monitoring of reporting cases raised by whistleblowers, publication of statistics. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? As a result of the introduction of comprehensive legislative protection for whistleblowers and the establishment of reporting channels, an increase in the number of credible reports of criminal offences or other unlawful activity is expected. This should result in a reduction of proceeds from corruption or other illegal activities that have been detected as a result of whistleblowing. The adoption of comprehensive legislation will then lead to an improvement in the status of whistleblowers in judicial or administrative proceedings, but also an improvement in the status of ex ante whistleblowers. An essential part of the Ministry of Justice's activities will be the raising awareness of society on the topic of whistleblowing, which, together with the adoption of the draft law and the Directive itself, represents a fundamental step towards improving the perception of whistleblowers in the Czech society. A change in the perception of whistleblowers as denunciators by the public, but also by potential whistleblowers themselves, is crucial to the success of the proposed regulation. In this sense, the Ministry of Justice will provide whistleblowers with comprehensible information regarding the reporting procedure itself, present model situations, familiarize whistleblowers with information on protecting their identity and, last but not least, clearly inform the public about what retaliation measures are and how to defend against them and point out their undesirable nature. 

Analysis of the commitment 

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? Entities in both the public and private sectors will be required to inform potential whistleblowers about the possibility to raise a report and about the rules for protection against retaliation. In addition, the Ministry of Justice will also be required to publish information on combating unlawful activities (on the website korupce.cz) and provide methodical and professional assistance in the whistleblower protection agenda.

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? Improving awareness of whistleblowing aims, inter alia, to increase the level of combating unlawful behaviour by public officials, to strengthen public control, including internal (in-house) preventive and control mechanisms. Corruption practices with a negative impact on society as a whole should thus be more easily detected and prosecuted. 

3. How will this commitment improve citizens' participation in the development, implementation, and monitoring of solutions adopted? Increasing the initiative of whistleblowers through the adoption of the Whistleblower Protection Act and improving public awareness of their status and usefulness aims to increase the level of civic participation in public affairs. Whistleblowers will be more motivated to detect wrongdoings of their employers and will be entitled to publish information about the infringement if the conditions set by law are met.

As the world changes, the legal foundation also requires supplementation. An international comparative study on lobby registers was carried out based on a commitment in the II Action Plan of open government. A parliamentary committee was established after the study and it issued an unanimous proposition recommending the establishment of the transparency register. 

The transparency register will offer citizens information on the parties that seek to influence decision-making. Decision-makers will be provided more in-depth information on the roles of the parties that seek to influence them. The register will help lobbyists to provide more information about their lobbying and influencing activities in an increasingly open manner.

Of the OGP initiatives, the transparency register corresponds particularly to that of transparency and accountability.

Establishment of transparency register
In accordance with the Government Programme, a law on the transparency register will be enacted after parliamentary preparation and consultation with civil society. The purpose of the act is to improve the transparency of decision-making and, through this, prevent inappropriate influences and strengthen public confidence.

In the preparation of the transparency register legislation, the basic rights and freedoms of natural persons will be taken into account and special attention will be paid to the safety of their personal data.

It will be established whether it will be possible to include data on the outside employment and private interests of public officials. Government officials are required to submit notifications of their private interests and outside employment. If working hours are used for the tasks of the outside employment or if it can impact the impartiality of a government official, a permit to engage in outside employment will be required. The data submitted has not been recorded in a register. 

It will furthermore be explored whether it will be possible to collect records of the parties invited to parliamentary committee hearings in a single transparency register. It could also be possible to append a list of the post-employment waiting period agreements as referred to in the State Civil Servants Act.

It will also be established whether it will be possible to collect private interests data on a municipal level into a national transparency register.

 To meet the citizens’ legitimate expectations and considering the large proportion of public funds spent by local and regional authorities, the financial transparency of these local authorities must be improved.
 CONTEXT & AIM Numerous local and regional authorities have begun using digital tools to account for their financial management and to increase budgetary transparency. The Government wishes to support and encourage this movement, which will be enhanced by the bill on the new territorial organization of the Republic (NOTRe). It will provide the legislative framework necessary to pursue this openness and data circulation policy, particularly regarding financial data. Currently, all documents attached to the budgets and accounts of city governments, including documents substantiating the accounts, may be communicated to anyone requesting them, in application of article L. 2121-26 of the local and regional authorities' general code. The publication of budgets and financial statements in open data has already been implemented by various local authorities such as the city of Rennes, the city of Montpellier, the city of Paris, the province of Hauts-de-Seine, the Provence Alpes Côtes d'Azur region… Furthermore, the Public Finances Directorate-General already publishes local authority financial files summarizing the main financial and tax issues, making information easy to access. They can be found on the joint site DGCL-DGFiP: collectivités-locales.gouv.fr. Further progress is planned in this area. It is planned to soon publish this information in open data. Lastly, since 2014 the financial jurisdictions3 initiated the opening of the first sets of public data, and now wish to go further with this approach, particularly by publishing more financial data.
 
 ROADMAP 
 - Allow citizens to better grasp the financial details of local and regional authorities - Publish in open data the general operating grant (Dotation globale de fonctionnement) which is the State's financial contribution to local and regional authorities - Publish in open data, on data.gouv.fr, all of account balances of local authorities and groups with specific taxation, from 2013 financial year onward - Make it compulsory for local executives and chairmen of EPCI to present a report to deliberative assembly (municipal, departmental or regional council) on the follow-up given to observations made by the regional chamber of the Cour des comptes 
 - Regularly provide the financial data of the financial jurisdictions such as: - The data used for the work on local finance - Some data on financial jurisdictions activities, notably the updated list of publications from the Cour des comptes and the resources of the financial jurisdictions
 - Strengthen open data in local and regional authorities: enshrine in law the requirement for local communities of more than 3500 inhabitants to publish their public information in open data format",NA,NA,Ministry of the Interior; Ministry for Decentralization and the Civil Service,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ND,ND,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ND,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2017,ND,ND,High,3,Yes,1,0,0,0,1,Moderate,2,Substantial,4,1,0,ND,ND,ND,ND,2018,Substantial,4,No Change,0,ND,ND,Major,3,Major,4,Not Applicable,0,Not Applicable,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,2,4,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,4,PotImp,https://opengovpartnership.org/members/france/commitments/fr0001,2018,0,AP_FRA01,1175

 Understanding of law and access to justice are the pillars of the Rule of Law. In a digital era, this ambition is not restricted to diffusing content of the law but requires also accessibility to jurisprudence, the possibility for all citizens to develop innovative tools or services based on this content (thanks to its availability in open data), and the ability to stimulate and successfully mobilize citizens' expertise and contributions.
 
 CONTEXT & AIM
 France already has created in 2001 a major public service for the dissemination of law over the Internet. According to the terms of decree No. 2002-1064 dated on August 7th, 2002 amended, on the public service for the dissemination of law over the Internet, the site Légifrance is intended to facilitate public access to texts in force as well as to jurisprudence. It already provides free, universal access to all sources of law (legislative and regulatory texts, treaties, codes, jurisprudence of the Constitutional Council, the Council of State and the French Supreme Court, etc.). The open-data provision of legal data and data relating to a legal bill or its preparation allows citizens to better understand the entire legislative process, develop tools or applications from this data and participate actively in the democratic debate.
 The opening of legal data is thus at the core of governmental action, with the open-data publication of the databases of the Legal and Administrative Information Department (DILA) of the Prime Minister’s Office, and the establishment of the ""Open Law"" program. This program has given rise to numerous innovative applications developed by start-ups, researchers and companies, which were then rewarded. The publication in open data of the Official Bulletin of Public Contract Declarations (BOAMP), the Civil and Commercial Announcements Official Bulletin (BODACC) and the Mandatory Legal Notices Official Bulletin (BALO) will complement this approach. 20 Lastly, the consultation of citizens on government bills or before their preparation enables the construction of effective public decisions may revitalizes democracy. When preparing the Digital Bill, the French Digital Council coordinated an online consultation over six months (see details and data in the ""methodology"" appendix). It demonstrated the extent and ability of administrations and civil society to commit to these processes.
 
 ROADMAP
 • Continue the open-data provision of legal and legislative resources that already exist - Continue the opening of legal data in reusable formats
 • Continue the collaborative process with civil society for the production of innovative services and open source tools facilitating the understanding of texts and their preparation
 • On the Digital Bill, continue the participative process in collaboration with civil society by opening the draft bill (“avant projet de loi”) to consultation for citizens to comment it and suggest amendments",NA,NA,"Prime Minister’s Office; Ministry of the Economy, Industry and the Digital Sector; Ministry of State for State Reform and Simplification attached to the Prime Minister",NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ND,ND,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ND,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2017,ND,ND,Medium,2,Yes,1,1,0,0,1,Transformative,3,Substantial,4,1,1,ND,ND,ND,ND,2018,Substantial,4,No Change,0,ND,ND,Marginal,2,Marginal,3,Marginal,3,Not Applicable,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,2,4,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,4,STAR,https://opengovpartnership.org/members/france/commitments/fr0015,2018,0,AP_FRA01,1189

The transposition of measures on the transparency in public life, to public agent, will further expand exemplarity within the civil service and obligations contained in the general statute of civil servants. A system will also be introduced to protect civil servants acting in good faith to report the existence of a conflict of interest.
 
 CONTEXT & AIM 
 More than thirty years after the enactment of the July 13th 1983 Bill, the bill on ethics and the rights and obligations of officials36 , when adopted, will update and complement the main fundamentals of the general statute of officials. In particular, it aims to apply to civil servants and members of administrative and financial jurisdictions, mechanisms on the prevention of conflicts of interests detailed in the bill on transparency in public life. The most exposed officials and administrative and financial magistrates will thus be required to complete declarations of interests before their appointments. Information on their assets will be passed on to the High Authority for Transparency in Public Life. An obligation to prevent and to resolve any conflict of interest will also be instituted. An offset mechanism has been put in place and a “management mandate” system will become mandatory for agents particularly concerned. Finally, a protection mechanism has been introduced in the general statute of officials to allow an agent acting in good faith to report the existence of a conflict of interest without fear of reprisals. The bill thus consecrates the active role to be played by each official and non-permanent agent under public law in the prevention of conflicts of interest: each agent is to act as the first guardian of ethical principles inherent to a civil servant position. This accountability of each public agent in the prevention of conflicts of interest complements an approach which, until now, has been under the sole responsibility of higher authorities of agents exposed to risk. 
 
 ROADMAP
 • Appoint an official, a service, or a legal entity under public law to provide agents under their authority with all relevant advice in respect of ethical obligations and principles
 • Introduce legal provisions to better prevent conflicts of interests and to protect civil servants 
 - Put in place a system for agents responsible for certain functions to declare their interests 
 - Reinforce and widen the area of competence of the ethics committee, which will be expanded to include the prevention of conflicts of interest and reinforced in the area of the control of civil servant’s transitions to the private sector

In this regard, it is essential for the legislation to provide high standards of openness and accountability, while its implementation in practice should not lead to unreasonable spending of public resources and accordingly tax payers’ money.
Therefore,  refinement of  the  laws on  freedom of  information and  ensuring  its compliance  with international standards is one of the objectives of the Georgian government.
Currently, the norms regulating access to public information are scattered in several laws, as well as significant difficulties are encountered in practical implementation of legislation. Taking into consideration practical challenges, elaboration of special law aims to eradicate legislative gaps and consolidate existing legal provisions in a separate act, which in turn will improve the practice of access to information and support the government, as well as civil society and wide community to establish open and accountable, rational and optimized civil service. The special act will emphasize openness policy of the government and will ease the work of the professionals involved in the area.
Ministry of Justice of Georgia will coordinate elaboration of freedom of information law in close cooperation with civil society. In order to ensure broad consultation process and wide involvement of stakeholders a special working group will be created. Based on consultations and international expertise the special working group will elaborate the new provisions of freedom of information in compliance with international standards. The first draft will be completed in spring, 2015.

Improving legal framework of freedom of information and elaborating new provisions in compliance with international standards which are gradually being implemented, is one of the top priorities for the government of Georgia. In the framework of the first Action Plan of Georgia, decree of the government of Goegira “About the Form of the Electronic Request of Information and Proactive Disclosure of Public Information” was adopted. Through this reform, Georgia became one of seven finalist countries at the “Bright Spots” competition held by the OGP Global Summit in London. The goal of the competition was to demonstrate successful reforms implemented as a result of civil society-government cooperation. At the next stage, the government started more ambitious project of elaborating a stand-along act on freedom of information. To carry out a wide-scale consultations, a special working group comprised of representatives from the Ministry of Justice, civil society, and independent experts was created. This working group carried out an important work: (1) to identified key problematic issues in the field, thematic working groups were established; (2) the first version of the project with potential amendments was drafted and submitted to the Anti-Corruption Council; (3) meetings with the focus groups (judges, journalists, persons responsible for information disclosure) were held; (4) the draft law prepared by the working group was presented to the Ministry of Justice; (5) the draft project underwent primary international expertise. Ministry of Justice will negotiate the draft law with all governmental agencies in the framework of the given Action Plan. After the detailed review of the draft law, in the framework of the Anti-corruption Council activities, Ministry of Justice will conduct one more consultation round with governmental and civil society organizations to finalize the text of the draft law.

 Current Situation and Challenges  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP):
 Since joining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Government of Georgia defined country-adjusted targets and indicators to implement the Goals at the national level. The Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 unequivocally recognizes the significant role of Parliaments in the implementation of SDGs, which includes the implementation of the SDG 16 (16.6 – “Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels”; 16.7 – “Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels”). Simultaneously, ensuring maximum openness, transparency and accountability of the process is crucial for ultimate success in this endeavor. The first steps were taken with the support of the European Union and UNDP: 
 • A new component was added to the action plans of Parliamentary Committees, which determines the compliance of the activities defined by the Committees’ action plans with the respective SDGs and demonstrates close connection between the national policy and the global agenda, thus also increasing the awareness of various stakeholders on SDGs in the process; 
 • A number of Committees have already committed through their action plans to hear the reports of relevant Ministries on the progress made towards implementing the SDGs. 
 Besides, in June 2018, with the support of the Swedish Government, UNDP and Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), and based on the IPU/UNDP methodology, the Parliament conducted a self-assessment exercise to check SDG readiness. The Exercise defined the role of the Parliament in the fulfillment of 2030 Agenda and outlined possible actions for SDGs implementation. 
 At this stage, the Parliament shall elaborate an action plan based on the results of the above self-assessment which shall include the introduction of parliamentary mechanisms and activities related to the Parliament’s lawmaking, oversight and citizen engagement functions. This will increase the involvement of the Parliament in SDG implementation and monitoring and ensure the institutionalization of this process in the Parliament. 
 
 Main Objective Increase Parliamentary involvement in the SDGs implementation and monitoring through civil society engagement and based on openness and transparency principles.

According to the Council of Europe's definition, open data is the publication of data and information in a format that may be freely used, modified and shared.9 The accessibility to open data enables businesses, NGOs, and government agencies to seamlessly access the required data, utilize it for developing applications and electronic services, and derive economic benefits. While government agencies in Georgia process open data, only a few of them make it available in a machine-readable format. In response to this challenge, an open data portal (data.gov.ge) was established as part of the Open Government Action Plan of Georgia for 2014-2015. This portal provides information from various government agencies, including data on procurement and government expenses, in an open format. The portal is administered by the LEPL – Digital Governance Agency of the Ministry of Justice of Georgia. While the open data portal exists, it should be noted that publication of data on the platform is voluntary, therefor it does not cover all government agencies. Moreover, there is a low level of awareness regarding both data publishing within government agencies and the use of the platform among the general public. Additionally, the growth in the volume of data published on the portal is impeded by the outdated technical and systemic infrastructure currently in place on data.gov.ge that needs to be addressed.

Brief description of the commitment 

As part of this commitment, the Administration of the Government of Georgia, in close collaboration with the LEPL – Digital Governance Agency, will develop a legal framework for open data. This framework will mandate government agencies to publish the open data they own on the portal Data.gov.ge. The commitment aims to enhance standards for the proactive publication of public information and open data.

Based on the recommendations from non-governmental organizations, OGP Georgia Forum members, the Administration of the Government of Georgia, in collaboration with partner agencies, initiated reforms to the existing system of allocating grant funding by state/public institutions in 2018. As evidenced by practice, Georgian legislation lacks provisions encompassing general principles and procedures for the allocation of grants by ministries and legal entities of public law. Additionally, there is no uniform legal standard governing the provision of grants by government agencies. Moreover, certain government agencies are not integrated into the existing government grant system. According to the final report on the implementation of the OGP Georgia Action Plan 2018-2019, collaborative efforts were initiated in 2018 by the Administration of the Government of Georgia and the OGP Georgia Forum member N(N)LE Civil Society Institute to reform the system of allocating grant funding by state/public institutions. A working group was formed, consisting of representatives from the Administration of the Government of Georgia, the Civil Society Institute, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure, and the Public Procurement Agency. Numerous meetings were conducted, resulting in the preparation of multiple versions of draft amendments to the Law of Georgia ""On Grants.” Several issues were agreed upon, while the need for additional work on certain topics was acknowledged. Depending on the significance of each issue, it is necessary to continue the ongoing process, conduct further consultations, and reach a consensus on the final version of the proposed draft law.

GE0100,Georgia,5,7,GEO,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2023,2025,2,NA,Defining key housing policy issues within the legal framework of social welfare reform,Housing Policy and Social Welfare Reform,"Description of the current state and the challenge 

Currently, the country lacks uniform statistics on homelessness and housing policy. The availability of such data is crucial for two main reasons: firstly, for planning effective housing policies and establishing the right priorities, and secondly, for monitoring the effectiveness of existing policies and specific measures. In line with international standards, housing policies must be formulated based on sector-specific statistics. 

Brief description of the commitment 

The absence of information regarding the extent of homelessness, its root causes, and the challenges faced by homeless and at-risk individuals, leads to a fragmented and inconsistent approach to addressing homelessness relying on short-term management principles. Thus, the country's legal and regulatory framework must include an obligation to collect and process data in the area of homelessness and housing policy, encompassing: - Legal definition of the ""homeless person” - Preparation and implementation of a unified methodology for creating, collecting, and processing data. - Processing of statistics on various aspects, including gender, age, social status, causes, forms, and individual needs of homelessness. To achieve these objectives, it is crucial to determine the entity responsible for producing statistics and the methods for systematizing them. Moreover, the development of this methodology must be preceded by the creation and approval of the appropriate legislative framework.

GE0101,Georgia,5,8,GEO,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2023,2025,2,NA,Accessibility of websites and mobile applications,Accessibility of Websites and Mobile Applications,"Description of the current state and the challenge 

The accessibility of government websites poses a significant challenge. On one hand, there is no established standard to which websites and applications must adhere. On the other hand, the absence of such standards leads to the adoption of divergent approaches in practice, contributing to the development of a less customer-oriented approach. Moreover, the same information and/or service may be duplicated across multiple websites and/or applications, indicating a misuse of resources. 

Brief description of the commitment 

The initiative seeks to standardize government agencies' websites and applications by establishing a uniform standard to streamline user access. It's worth noting that there exists a European Union standard in the form of European Directive (EU) 2016/2102. While this Directive is not explicitly incorporated into the Association Agreement, Georgia's progressive alignment with EU standards in any capacity signifies a positive advancement.

DE0044,Germany,4,1,DEU,Europe,National,1,2023,2025,2,NA,Drafting and shepherding through Parliament of a Transparency Act,Creation of Transparency Act,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Access to official information and public records is possible through many channels. The legal preconditions for that access, however, are enshrined in various laws. The following are unclear: conditions of access, permissible reasons for refusals and exceptions, formats to be used, obligations on providers to prepare files, possibilities for reuse or searchability tools. Elements of them overlap; some are contradictory. Publication practice to date has been mixed and is not yet entirely consistent, active and structured. The information and data that are made public could be made easier to find. In some areas, the rules for reuse are unclear. 

What is the commitment? The Federal Government will introduce a bill which refines the legal basis for access to information and data and shepherd it through Parliament. It is examining to what extent existing freedom of information laws can be amalgamated and unified. The intention is also to improve the substantive criteria for granting access. For certain categories of information and data, an obligation to publish proactively is to be created. A centralised transparency platform is to ensure that, once published, information and data can be found. The law will establish a legal entitlement to open data. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? The Transparency Act will create a cohesive legal framework governing access to and reuse of official information and data. This will result in legal certainty and clarity and will improve the availability of data. Expanded publication obligations and access rights will mean more information and data available to the individual and to the public at large. The obligation to publish proactively and the legal entitlement of the individual to open data will contribute to more effective accessing practice. A centralised transparency platform will make things easier to find. Freedom of information and open data will be brought together. The right of the individual to access information, formerly vouchsafed through freedom of information, will be brought closer to the legal regime governing open data by the obligation to publish proactively; the obligation to make public records accessible as open data, formerly enshrined in generally applicable law, will come into closer alignment with freedom of information as a result of the legal entitlement of the individual. This closer alignment will serve to better satisfy the demand for information from policymakers, industry, academia and society, to the benefit of the data economy as a whole. 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? In creating the Transparency Act, the Federal Government is making great strides in the direc- tion of openness and transparency. The legally enshrined routes for accessing information are to be imbued with a new quality, improve cooperation within the government, foster oversight of administration and government, and enhance people’s options for participating in the political process. The resultant availability of data for business, researchers, civil society and the state will serve the common good.

Pursuant to this commitment, the country has amended its Petroleum Revenue Management Act of 2011 (Act 815) to address some major challenges identified in the course of its implementation in the last four years.
 To effectively operationalize the amended law, there will be the need to develop regulations (Legislative Instruments) that will detail out how the various clauses are to be interpreted and applied. The Ghana OGP’s interest in ensuring the quick passage of the regulations arises out of the tendency for regulations to primary laws to be unduly delayed, thereby impeding their smooth implementation.
 The commitment to strengthen transparency and accountability in the management of the country’s oil and gas revenues is to be pursued additionally through the effective oversight of the Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC), a citizens’ oversight body established by the Petroleum Revenue Management Act (PRMA). PIAC has had challenges with funding, and the necessary institutional support for its work. These are issues that are currently being addressed following the amendment of the PRMA and with support from some of the country’s development partners.
 In the wake of the relatively impressive achievements made by Ghana in managing its petroleum revenues judiciously and in accordance with the law, calls are being made on the government to replicate this arrangement in the mining sector too. In partial response to the suggestion, the government is inclined to expedite action in passing a Minerals Development Fund Bill which has been in the works for a decade and more. The bill, when passed will stipulate how 20 percent of mineral royalty set aside is distributed and spent. It will further provide legislative backing for the practice of disbursing 10 percent of mineral royalty to mining host districts.",NA,NA,"Ministry of Finance, GHEITI, Ministry of Petroleum, Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources","National Commission on Civic Education, Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC), Oil and Gas Platform",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ND,ND,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ND,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2017,ND,ND,High,3,Yes,1,1,1,0,1,Transformative,3,Substantial,4,1,1,ND,ND,ND,ND,2018,Substantial,4,No Change,0,ND,ND,Marginal,2,Did Not Change,2,Marginal,3,Did Not Change,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,2,4,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,4,STAR,https://opengovpartnership.org/members/ghana/commitments/gh0018,2018,0,AP_GHA02,1350

To minimize the misuse of entrusted power for private gain, there is the need to pass all outstanding anti-corruption enhancing bills and also ensure that anti-corruption institutions and quasi security agencies report on their activities. For example, asset declaration by public office holders in its current form is not meaningful when it comes to transparency. Public office holders need to be transparent when it comes to asset declaration. The key issues regarding asset declaration by public office holders relate to asset declaration, verification, and publication.; What is the commitment?: The commitment is in two parts namely: gradually amend Asset Declaration Act (Conduct of Public Office Holders Bill) to enable verification and publication of assets declared by public office holders; and ensure investigative bodies (like Criminal Investigation Department -CID and Bureau of National Investigation -BNI), anti-corruption institutions (like CHRAJ), and quasi security institutions (like EOCO) charged to investigate corruption related issues to make public reports of their investigations.; How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem?: Making public reports on corruption related investigations will let the public know the outcome of corruption related investigations.

GR0090,Greece,5,8,GRC,Europe,National,1,2022,2024,2,NA,Whistleblowing Platform in accordance with Directive (EU) 2019/1937,Whistleblowing Platform for Breaches of EU Law,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

Through whistleblowing platform, employees in private and public bodies will be able to report breaches of EU law anonymously and without fear of retaliation.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? The commitment addresses the issue of secure and anonymous online reporting on breaches of Union law. Persons who work for a public or private organisation or are in contact with such an organisation in the context of their work-related activities are often the first to know about threats or harm to the public interest which arise in that context. By reporting breaches of Union law that are harmful to the public interest, such persons act as ‘whistleblowers’ and thereby play a key role in exposing and preventing such breaches and in safeguarding the welfare of society. It concerns employed persons in the public or private sector (employees, self-employed persons, shareholders and persons belonging to the administrative, management or supervisory body of an undertaking, including non-executive members, as well as volunteers and paid or unpaid trainees). 

2. What are the causes of the problem? Potential whistleblowers are often discouraged from reporting their concerns or suspicions for fear of retaliation. In this context, the importance of ensuring a balanced and effective protection of whistleblowers is increasingly recognised both at EU and international level. Article 11 of law 4990/2022 (Government Gazette, Series I, No 210) provides that the National Transparency Authority, within its responsibilities as a national reporting channel, will maintain and manage the electronic system for external reporting (Whistleblowing). Through the online platform, employees in private and public bodies will be able to report anonymously safely and without fear of retaliation, illegal behaviours and practices taking place within the organisation that harm corporate reputation and lead to direct and indirect financial losses. Whistleblowing enhances integrity, accountability and trust within the organisation. 

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? The National Transparency Authority receives reports – either anonymous or named- submitted via its official website. However, in the case of anonymous reports, it is not possible for the case investigator to contact the reporting person. Law 4990/2022 transposes Directive (EU) 2019/1937which lays down the obligation to set out rules aimed at introducing common standards for the effective protection of whistleblowers. In accordance with a general principle of EU law, Member States are free to choose how to incorporate a directive into their national legislation. In this case, the directive was transposed through adoption of a formal law since there was no enabling basis for the adoption of a presidential decree or other regulatory act.

2. What solution are you proposing? Directive (EU) 2019/1937 sets the new rules at EU level on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law. The transposition of the Directive into national law fills an important legislative gap that has existed so far. Among other things, the Directive provides for safe, effective and widely available reporting channels and strong protection for whistleblowers, working both in the public and private sectors across the EU, from dismissal, relegation and other forms of retaliation. Public and private bodies should develop practical guidelines and methodologies that allow and encourage people working in private and public bodies to report illegitimate and delinquent behaviours that come to their attention, without fear of retaliation. A whistleblowing platform is an online system for receiving and managing reports, designed to enable any employee in the private or public sector to anonymously, securely and confidentially report illegal behaviours and practices. Upon submission of the complaint, he/she is given the opportunity, through a unique 16-digit code, to anonymously monitor the progress of his/her report. The main objective is to strengthen the level of whistleblower protection, while further aiming at institutionally reinforcing transparency and integrity. Article 11 of law 4990/2022 provides that the National Transparency Authority will act as an external reporting channel, i.e. as the competent Authority for receiving, managing and monitoring reports on violations falling within the scope of the law. Via the online platform, employees in private and public bodies will be able to submit safely and without fear of retaliation anonymous reports on illegal behaviors and practices taking place within the organisation that harm corporate reputation and lead to direct and indirect financial losses. Whistleblowing enhances integrity, accountability and trust within the organisation. The whistleblowing platform will include an online application for anonymous reporting through a secure online communication channel and a management environment for the evaluation and investigation of reports. The front end of the web application is tailored according to the functional requirements as they result from the Directive and bears the logo of the National Transparency Authority. The management environment allows the receiving and monitoring of reports by authorized case investigators in a secure manner. The reporting person (whistleblower) submits his/her report by filling in the electronic form. The whistleblower may also attach electronic files to support his/her report — these may include documents, photographs or videos. Once the whistleblower has completed the submission of the report, he/she receives an immediate confirmation. All information about a reported incident is stored electronically and securely in the case management system. The whistleblower has the possibility to create a secure Post-Box with password-controlled access, which is used to support two-way communication with the case investigator, in case he/she chooses to remain anonymous. The interaction with the whistleblower may be 100% anonymous. In essence, anonymous communication is conducted between the case investigator and the whistleblower in order to collect further information on the reported incident. The whistleblower may periodically visit this Post-Box to check and respond to messages from the case investigator. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? The objective of the commitment is to encourage persons — to whom an event or information that constitutes or is likely to constitute a breach of Union law has come to their notice — to report this event or information to the competent authorities. The establishment of an effective network of protection for persons reporting breaches of Union law is essential to encourage such persons to disclose breaches of public interest. Under the provisions of the law, such persons enjoy important safeguards in such a way that, on the one hand there is no risk of prosecution or retaliation and on the other hand their information becomes confidential and protected. Strengthening the protection of whistleblowers contributes to the prevention and deterrence of breaches of Union law, and thus to the protection of the public interest. 

Commitment Analysis 

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? At Union level, reports and public disclosures by whistleblowers are one upstream component of enforcement of Union law and policies. They feed national and Union enforcement systems with information, leading to effective detection, investigation and prosecution of breaches of Union law, thus enhancing transparency and accountability. 

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? By reporting breaches of Union law that are harmful to the public interest, such persons act as ‘whistleblowers’ and thereby play a key role in exposing and preventing such breaches and in safeguarding the welfare of society. Whistleblowing enhances integrity, accountability and trust within the organisation. 

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions?  The establishment of an effective network of protection for persons reporting breaches of Union law encourage persons — to whom an event or information that constitutes or is likely to constitute a breach of Union law has come to their notice — to report this event or information to the competent authorities.

GR0096,Greece,5,14,GRC,Europe,National,1,2022,2024,2,NA,Public Database and Special Register of Civil Society Organisations,Public Database and Special Register of Civil Society Organisations,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

Development of two electronic platforms, namely a Public Database and a Special Register of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the Ministry of Interior, with a view to registering CSOs that meet specific criteria and conditions for transparency and accountability, in order to receive state funding

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? • There was no single framework regulating the state’s relations with civil society organisations as a whole. • In recent years, scattered legislation had been adopted from time to time, leading to fragmentation of the legal framework for civil society. Indicatively, there are 9 different registers in respective ministries registering NGOs. Some registers include Social Cooperative Enterprises (KOINSEP) or Private Capital Companies (IKEs) that are not civil society organisations but companies. • Frequent allegations of abuse have led to a misguided equation of the Civil Society Organisations producing real work, with those organisations that have exploited society’s charitable feelings. • Law 4873/2021 establishes a single regulatory framework for Civil Society Organisations, which aims to create a culture of integrity, transparency and accountability in the state funding of CSOs. 

2. What are the causes of the problem? Fragmentation in the regulation of issues relating to the registration, inscription and financing of CSOs established and operating in Greece as associations or civil nonprofit companies with a public benefit purpose resulting in the inability to operate a single register with clear rules and conditions. 

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? Voting and adoption of the necessary regulatory framework for the regulation of Civil Society Organisations (Law 4873/2021) and laying down the conditions for the creation of the two registers. It is the first time that a single legislative framework regulates the state’s relations with civil society with the minimum possible state intervention and that the foundations are laid for civil society to evolve freely. 

2. What solution are you proposing? • Completion of the creation of the two electronic databases, namely a Public Database and a Special Register of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the Directorate of CSOs and Public Benefit Entities in the Ministry of the Interior, for the purpose of the systematic registration and inscription of these public benefit entities, in accordance with the conditions laid down by the Law. • The Public Database and the Special Register will be 2 specific applications, accessible through the Single Digital Portal of Public Administration (gov.gr ΕΨΠ) and in order for a CSO to be able to be registered in these it will have to submit a series of supporting documents, as listed in Article 6 & 7 of Law 4873/2021. • The Public Database and the Special Register will be composed of the CSO index, the dossier kept separately for each CSO including specific supporting documents, as well as certifications of competent authorities (Law 4873/2021). 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? • The aim is to ensure the integrity, transparency, sound management and accountability of civil society organisations, in particular in order to avoid instances of non-transparent funding. • Linking government funding to transparency-supervision-accounting, but also to more favourable tax treatment of organisations fulfilling specific criteria • Establishing common principles and criteria for transparency and accountability for state funding • Central Management and Control of all necessary supporting documents/conditions for funding • Creation of two electronic databases recording CSOs wishing to be supervised in order to meet specific transparency and accountability criteria and conditions and receive government funding • Mapping of CSOs • Incentivising the creation of strong CSOs and the provision of donations for charitable purposes 

Commitment Analysis 

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? The information that will be included on the website of the databases and will be freely accessible to citizens will consist of the name of the public benefit entity, the contact details, the constituent act with changes thereto and the list of administrative bodies, without prejudice to Law 4624/2019 (GG A 137) on the protection of personal data. 

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? The creation of the two registers will contribute to: a) Creating a culture of integrity, transparency and accountability in the state funding of CSOs. b) The development of effective policies through the appropriate information of competent bodies. c) Creating incentives for reliable CSOs. 

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? The publication of the corresponding data further strengthens public confidence in public institutions.

 Descripción del compromiso
 ¿Cuál es la
 problemática que el
 compromiso aborda?
 Guatemala en búsqueda de fomentar la transparencia y prevenir la corrupción, se ha
 adherido a diversas iniciativas internacionales, tales como, la Alianza para el Gobierno
 Abierto (OGP) e Iniciativa Global de Transparencia Fiscal (GIFT), entre otras. Por su parte,
 varios organismos internacionales evalúan la gestión de las finanzas públicas, y mediante
 informes periódicos han formulado recomendaciones al país para mejorar y eficientar la
 gestión pública.
 Por consiguiente es recomendable analizar para su adopción, una serie de instrumentos
 que conforman la estructura global de normas de transparencia fiscal, como el Código y
 Manual de Transparencia Fiscal del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI), el Estándar del
 Foro Global sobre Transparencia e Intercambio de Información con Fines Tributarios de
 la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económicos (OCDE), el Estándar de
 Datos para las Contrataciones Abiertas de la Open Contracting Partnership (OCP) y los
 principios de la Iniciativa Global de Transparencia Fiscal (GIFT), entre otros.
 Los resultados de las evaluaciones demuestran la necesidad que el país avance en
 realizar acciones que garanticen el cumplimiento de los estándares internacionales que
 coadyuven a elevar el nivel de transparencia y de mejora en la gestión pública. Por
 ejemplo, como resultado de la adopción del Código y Manual del Fondo Monetario
 Internacional (FMI), es pertinente atender las recomendaciones pendientes que están
 contenidas en la Evaluación de Transparencia Fiscal elaborada por una misión técnica
 del FMI en marzo y abril de 2016. En el marco del Foro Global de la OCDE, como segundo
 ejemplo, Guatemala aunque mejoró su calificación en julio de 2017, deberá someterse a
 una revisión completa para confirmarla o revertirla, y demostrar si está en capacidad de
 intercambiar información con otros países, para fines tributarios.
 Por lo anterior, es recomendable que el Gobierno de Guatemala, a través de las
 instituciones públicas correspondientes, brinde seguimiento e implemente gradualmente,
 en función de su viabilidad legal, técnica, financiera, o de cualquier otra naturaleza, las
 acciones que se consideren necesarias para cumplir satisfactoriamente los estándares
 internacionales y buenas prácticas que apuntan a la transparencia fiscal, rendición de
 cuentas, participación ciudadana y acceso a la información pública.
 Por otra parte, considerando que muchas de las recomendaciones podrían implicar
 cambios en la legislación vigente o acciones que superen los dos años de vigencia del
 Cuarto Plan de Acción Nacional de Gobierno Abierto 2018-2020, es aconsejable
 conformar equipos de trabajo y elaborar hojas de ruta o planes de acción, para definir las 
 135
 actividades que se pueden ir alcanzando durante la vigencia de cada Plan de Acción
 Nacional de Gobierno Abierto.
 ¿Cuál es el
 compromiso?
 Publicar en la página del Ministerio de Finanzas Públicas los estándares internacionales
 y buenas prácticas de transparencia fiscal adoptados por Guatemala. Para ello se deberá
 desarrollar una estrategia de comunicación para que la población conozca el detalle
 actualizado de las iniciativas y los estándares vigentes en materia de transparencia, así
 como dar a conocer los informes de evaluación y las recomendaciones efectuadas por
 cada iniciativa según corresponda.
 Complementariamente también es importante que se muestren los alcances y dificultades
 de implementar cada recomendación, así como los avances y resultados que se están
 obteniendo en cada caso e identificar los desafíos o metas pendientes y otros espacios
 de mejora.
 ¿Cómo contribuirá a
 resolver la
 problemática?
 Informar a la población guatemalteca sobre las especificaciones de los estándares
 internacionales y buenas prácticas en materia de transparencia fiscal, así como de los
 informes de evaluación que se han practicado en el país y las recomendaciones que han
 efectuado los diversos organismos internacionales, contribuye a mejorar los procesos de
 auditoría social sobre las acciones gubernamentales en pro de la transparencia fiscal, ya
 que proporciona la información necesaria para evaluar la gestión pública en general.
 Puede también ayudar a apuntalar la credibilidad de la gestión de las finanzas públicas y
 facilitar la vigilancia del desarrollo fiscal en el escenario económico internacional,
 posicionando a Guatemala en una mejor ubicación dentro del ranking internacional.
 Avanzar en la implementación de estándares internacionales posibilita dar a conocer el
 accionar de la administración pública, por lo que el fácil y oportuno acceso a la información
 pública es una condición previa para que los ciudadanos comprendan cómo el gobierno
 utiliza sus facultades para llevar adelante la política fiscal, bajo principios de transparencia
 y eficiencia. Por ello se requieren acciones que permitan avanzar hacia sistemas de
 transparencia fiscal, rendición de cuentas, participación ciudadana y acceso a la
 información pública, no solo para asegurar la probidad en la administración y ejecución
 del gasto público, sino también para favorecer su eficiencia y concordancia con el interés
 general de la sociedad guatemalteca.
 Adicionalmente, el cumplimiento efectivo de los estándares de transparencia fiscal puede
 contribuir a identificar espacios de mejora normativa e institucional en esta materia, pero
 también a mejorar las calificaciones del país en evaluaciones especializadas (como la
 Evaluación de Transparencia Fiscal del FMI, la evaluación del programa de Gasto Público
 y Rendición de Cuentas -PEFA-, las evaluaciones del Foro Global de la OCDE, entre
 otros), así como en mediciones como el Índice de Presupuesto Abierto de la International
 Budget Partnership (IBP).
 ¿Por qué es relevante
 a los valores de OGP?
 El compromiso contribuye a mejorar las buenas prácticas en materia de transparencia
 fiscal y es relevante porque busca fomentar el acceso a la información pública por parte
 de la población, facilitando los procesos de rendición de cuentas y participación
 ciudadana.

HN0082,Honduras,5,3,HND,Americas,National,1,2023,2025,2,NA,Sistema de denuncias ciudadanas para combatir la corrupción.,System of Citizen Complaints to Combat Corruption,"Breve descripción del compromiso 

Instalación del sistema de denuncias ciudadanas para combatir la corrupción que consiste en hacer uso de las Tecnologías de la Información y Comunicación (TIC) poniendo a disposición de la ciudadanía mediante una línea telefónica gratuita, que pueda ingresar desde el teléfono móvil o fijo. Asimismo, se puede tener acceso a través de internet mediante el llenado de un formulario disponible en la plataforma web de la STLCC, que estará acompañado por un chatbot durante todo el proceso de recepción de la denuncia. Se asignará un número de ticket para que las mismas puedan ser atendidas por las entidades correspondientes bajo un seguimiento especializado. El sistema garantiza que los datos del ciudadano sean manejados con total confidencialidad y tendrá la opción de presentar denuncias de manera anónima. Para brindar la seguridad debida de los denunciantes, se presentará como iniciativa de ley la protección a denunciantes de buena fe (o Ley de Whistleblowers). Se implementará una campaña masiva de concientización sobre la importancia de denunciar hechos constitutivos de delito o infracción administrativa (según la legislación vigente del país) y la existencia del mecanismo de denuncia disponible. Por último, se elaborará un protocolo del tratamiento de denuncias y traslado a las autoridades competentes para abrir líneas de investigación o planificar, ampliar objetivos y/o el alcance de las auditorías en curso y, en su caso, aplicación de las sanciones correspondientes.

Definición del problema 

En la última década, se ha reflejado una alta incidencia de la corrupción en las instituciones públicas y privadas, socavando la confianza ciudadana, el Estado de derecho y el uso eficiente de los recursos públicos. Según el Índice de Percepción de la Corrupción, parte de Transparencia Internacional, Honduras ocupó en el año 2021 el puesto 157 de 180 países evaluados, con una puntuación de 23/100. Para el 2022, se estima que el MP recibió por delitos relacionados a actos de corrupción un total de 16,701 denuncias. Por su parte, el TSC registró para el 2022 un total de 160 denuncias. Según el Global Corruption Barometer edición 2019, el 54% de los hondureños consideran que los niveles de corrupción habían incrementado y 62% consideró que el gobierno estaba haciendo un mal trabajo en la lucha contra la corrupción. La corrupción es un problema estructural que se ha agudizado en los últimos años, debido a la debilidad institucional, la falta de transparencia, rendición de cuentas, la impunidad y la escasa participación ciudadana. Según una encuesta realizada por el Instituto Universitario en Democracia, Paz y Seguridad (IUDPAS) en 2019, el 81% de los hondureños considera que la corrupción ha aumentado en los últimos cinco años. Además, el 74% cree que las instituciones encargadas de combatir la corrupción son ineficaces o muy ineficaces. Los hondureños se ven gravemente afectados por la corrupción, especialmente los más vulnerables y excluidos que ven limitadas sus oportunidades de acceso a servicios básicos, justicia, seguridad y participación. La corrupción también afecta al sector privado que enfrenta mayores costos y riesgos para invertir y generar empleo. El problema ha impactado negativamente en el desarrollo humano y económico del país. Según el Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD), Honduras tiene un índice de desarrollo humano de 0.634, lo que lo sitúa en el puesto 132 de 189 países. Asimismo, según el Banco Mundial, Honduras tiene un ingreso per cápita de 2,480 dólares, lo que lo ubica como un país de ingreso medio bajo. Finalmente, este flagelo también ha contribuido a generar condiciones de violencia e inseguridad. 

2. ¿Cuáles son las causas del problema? La falta de recursos y capacidades técnicas, la resistencia por parte de la mayoría de los actores gubernamentales, la falta de confianza de la sociedad civil y ciudadanía en las instituciones públicas y operadores de justicia para interponer denuncias. Para el 2022 Honduras cuenta con una tasa de homicidios por cada 100 mil habitantes de 35.8%, evidenciando que la violencia y la inseguridad persisten en el país siendo estos problemas históricos que han protagonizado la realidad hondureña durante años. Esto ha incrementado el temor de los ciudadanos para denunciar actos de corrupción, debido que, pueden recibir represalias y poner en riesgo su integridad. En el caso de la corrupción, al igual que en otros países centroamericanos, Honduras no cuenta con una legislación de protección específica a denunciantes de este delito, solamente cuenta con una Ley de Protección de Testigos en proceso penal. 

Descripción del compromiso 

1. ¿Qué se ha hecho hasta ahora para resolver el problema? Con la creación de la STLCC, nace la Unidad de Gestión y Denuncia Ciudadana (UGDC), unidad técnica responsable de orientar los esfuerzos de las instituciones del Estado en el fomento de la transparencia y ética pública en cada una de las acciones de los funcionarios y servidores públicos; propiciando un espacio de participación ciudadana mediante una línea telefónica y canales a digitales, con el fin de promover los principios de transparencia, rendición de cuentas y la lucha contra la corrupción. Asimismo, se cuenta con la figura del Comité de Probidad y Ética por medio del Código de Conducta Ética del servidor público, integrado por cinco servidores públicos electos, y que funcionan en los entes y organismos del sector público gubernamental con el fin de promover el cumplimiento de las normas de conducta ética, dentro de sus funciones se encuentran la de conocer las denuncias sobre posibles violaciones a las normas de conducta ética y fomentar una cultura de denuncia al interior de las instituciones públicas. La STLCC a través de la ONADICI ha impulsado la instalación de los Comité de Control Interno (COCOIN) dentro de las instituciones públicas, con el objetivo principal de contribuir a la eficaz y eficiente implementación, mantenimiento y mejora continua del control interno institucional; siendo para ello una importante instancia de coordinación, asesoramiento, consulta y seguimiento oportuno. Actualmente, se cuentan con 106 comités de control interno instalados en las instituciones del Poder Ejecutivo y Gobiernos locales. Finalmente, el TSC actualmente cuenta con un sistema web de denuncias ciudadanas30. 

2. ¿Qué solución propone? Para enfrentar este problema se requiere de una acción coordinada entre el Estado, la sociedad civil, el sector privado, el sector academia y la cooperación internacional, encaminada a la promoción de una cultura de integridad y transparencia, fortaleciendo las capacidades institucionales para prevenir e investigar la corrupción, garantizando la aplicación efectiva de la ley y que fomente la participación ciudadana en el control social. Asimismo, el compromiso se acompaña con la iniciativa de ley de protección a denunciantes de buena fe (o Ley de Whistleblowers) sobre delitos de corrupción, con el objetivo de contar con un marco normativo encaminado a evitar represalias para los informantes y garantizar su integridad personal y física, que les genere confianza a los ciudadanos sobre denunciar los actos de corrupción. De igual manera, la elaboración de un protocolo del tratamiento de denuncias y traslado a las autoridades competentes para abrir líneas de investigación o planificar, ampliar objetivos y/o el alcance de las auditorías en curso y, en su caso, aplicación de las sanciones correspondientes, para incrementar la confianza sobre los mecanismos de denuncia y la efectividad de los mismos. 

3. ¿Qué resultados queremos lograr con la implementación de este compromiso? La implementación del Sistema de Denuncias Ciudadanas acompañado de una campaña masiva de concientización sobre la importancia de denunciar hechos constitutivos de delito o infracción administrativa (según la legislación vigente del país) y la existencia del mecanismo de denuncia disponible que aumente la confianza de los ciudadanos sobre su efectividad para combatir la corrupción y logre disminuir el temor de los ciudadanos en denunciar los actos de corrupción. 

Análisis del compromiso 

1. ¿Cómo promoverá la transparencia el compromiso? Con la instalación del Sistema de Denuncias Ciudadanas para combatir la Corrupción se pondrá a disposición del ciudadano una plataforma web para poder interponer denuncias por actos de corrupción (según la ley vigente del país). En la plataforma web el ciudadano, además de poder interponer denuncia, podrá acceder a información esencial para concientización sobre la importancia de denunciar hechos constitutivos de delito o infracción administrativa y el funcionamiento del mecanismo de denuncia disponible. Tendrá a disposición información sobre los deberes y obligaciones de los funcionarios para poder identificar cuando exista infracción a los mismos o prácticas colusorias, así como las instancias en dónde deberá interponer las denuncias por otros tipos de delitos que no se encuentran enmarcados dentro de la competencia del sistema de denuncias, estableciendo con claridad los pasos, plazos y el rol correspondiente de quien interpone la denuncia. 

2. ¿Cómo ayudará el compromiso a fomentar la rendición de cuentas? Con la implementación del sistema estará disponible la información y datos sobre las auditorías, investigaciones y aplicación de sanciones producto del traslado de denuncias, siempre y cuando no contravenga las disposiciones de la Ley de Transparencia y Acceso a la Información Pública respecto a la reserva de información. Asimismo, se publicará un informe semestral y conjuntos de datos (mensuales) relacionados al número de denuncias recibidas y el tratamiento que recibieron (categorizando si se enmarcan en algún delito o infracción administrativa). 

3. ¿Cómo mejorará el compromiso la participación ciudadana en la definición, implementación y seguimiento de soluciones? Con la implementación del sistema la ciudadanía tomará un rol activo en la prevención y facilitación del combate a la corrupción al poner a disposición una herramienta para interponer las denuncias correspondientes. A través de las jornadas de socialización a nivel nacional se promueve el uso responsable del sistema dando a conocer la importancia de denunciar hechos constitutivos de delito o infracción administrativa (según la legislación vigente del país) y las instancias y mecanismos existentes para denunciar los mismos.

To this date, victims of serious human rights violations have received little attention. Children who are victims of human rights violations, for example, do not get scholarships to continue their education because scholarship requirements are always related to academic achievement. Another example is that there is no government assistance to remove bullets in the body of victims in Aceh. Currently, 40,000 civilians have become victims of the conflict in Aceh. In this regard, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has a significant role in assisting local governments in implementing the recovery of victims of human rights violations. Currently, the TRC Bill is in the discussion stage. If there is the involvement of civil society in the discussion of the TRC Bill, the regulation is expected to strengthen the TRC's position and accelerate the recovery of serious human rights violations. 61 What is the commitment? There is a meaningful involvement of civil society in every stage of the TRC bill discussion. How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? It is hoped that civil society's involvement in the deliberation of the TRC Bill will be able to strengthen the TRC's position in providing recommendations and assisting in the recovery of victims of serious human rights violations. The TRC's involvement in the recovery process provides an opportunity for the community to find out what steps the local and central government have taken in aiding victims. This will help many victims who have been neglected and do not receive the attention they deserve. Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? This commitment will support the Open Government value, namely participation. The existence of public participation in the KKR Bill discussion will increase the effectiveness of the subsequent TRC performance. Why is this commitment relevant to Indonesian Medium-Term National Development Plan (RPJMN) and SDGs? This program will support the SDGs Goal, mainly target 16.3, to promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice. Also, this commitment is in accordance to the RPJMN 2020-2024 page 236 point 2 letter b, also known as the application of restorative justice; by optimizing the usage of regulations provided in-laws and regulations that supports restorative justice, optimizing the roles of the customary institution and other institutions related to alternative dispute resolution, including prioritizing efforts to provide rehabilitation, compensation, and restitution for victims, including victims of human rights violation Additional information. - Milestone Activity with a verifiable deliverable Start Date End Date The implementation of meaningful involvement of civil society in the drafting of the TRC Bill.

Drafting of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Draft Law (RUU KKR) with public inputs and participation. Making progress with the RUU KKR is important as a legal basis for revealing the truth about past gross human rights violations, especially at a national scale.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? Human rights violations impact victims in many ways. Economically, for example, many women who are mothers, wives or children of victims experience trauma and live in poverty. Other victims are elderly persons with health problems in addition to their economic and social problems. Despite this, a negative stigma still surrounds the public’s perceptions regarding them. Furthermore, in addition to having the right to material and physical wellbeing, victims of human rights violations should also have the right to truth, and to receive acknowledgment from the state regarding the events which occurred to them. At the national level as well as at the local level in Papua, there is no truth-seeking mechanism yet. After the cancellation of Law Number 27 Year 2004 regarding the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2006 by the Constitutional Court, the executive and legislative government have attempted to draft another law, which still hasn't been made a national priority up to date. Efforts should be made in establishing truth and reconciliation commission (“TRC”) that is supported by a strong legal basis, as its presence is important in providing victims with the truth, formal acknowledgment and apologies from the state, as well as efforts relating to peace, law enforcement, rehabilitation, and other matters that victims of gross human rights violations have the right to receive. Based on the concept of transitional justice, truth-seeking mechanisms are an integral part of justice, reparation and institutional reform efforts. Because it is important to have an adequate legal basis to establish a TRC, it is essential for the public to be meaningfully involved in its drafting process. Reflecting on Indonesia’s experience with the previous Law that the Constitutional Court annulled, the contents of RUU KKR this time must reflect the victims’ perspective and prioritize their wellbeing, and the drafting process must be participatory, open, transparent and accountable. The existence of a regulation for TRC at the national level can also strengthen the establishment of a TRC in Papua and West Papua. Furthermore, having a strong TRC regulation at the national level can also strengthen the TRC implementation in Aceh, especially for matters where there are still policy gaps at the regional level. For example, in Aceh, there is no Government Regulation that clearly regulates the process of implementing the recommendations for reparations provided by the Aceh TRC to the Government. 

2. What are the causes of the problem? In Aceh, one of the problems in providing recovery for victims of human rights violations is the absence of a Government Regulation to clearly regulate the process of implementing the Aceh TRC’s recommendations. This legal absence affects the lack of budgeting from the government, the persistence of bureaucratic access to justice which do not prioritize the victims’ needs, as well as other technical and non-technical problems such as the identification of victims, needs analysis, and recommendations provided to the Aceh Government. These things hinder the provision of reparations from being delivered properly. Furthermore, the judicial process for resolving cases of human rights violations in Indonesia has been slow and considerably does not provide the justice which victims deserve. For example, the Human Rights Court for the Tanjung Priok and East Timor Cases acquitted the main perpetrators, and the perpetrators who were convicted at the court during the first instance were acquitted at the appeal or cassation level. This can increase the victim's distrust towards the state, especially after the previous TRC Law was repealed. For this reason, the formation of a TRC supported by a strong legal basis can be a means for victims to obtain their rights, especially the right to truth and to receive state acknowledgment of the victims' rights. 

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? At the national level, the Tifa Foundation together with Yayasan Indonesia untuk Kemanusiaan have developed research and recommendations regarding resolving past gross human rights violations and fulfilling victims' rights, involving civil society, victims’ communities, and experts in the process namely through dialogues and discussions. The results will be advocated to the state and shared for public education. Additionally, at the local level in Aceh, Tifa Foundation has supported the efforts of KontraS Aceh in formulating standard procedures regarding recommendations for reparations, even though they are only internally binding for the Aceh TRC. KontraS Aceh and Tifa Foundation’s efforts contributed to the Aceh TRC’s findings in 2020, which was acknowledged by the Governor of Aceh through the Decree of the Governor of Aceh Number 330/1209/2020 regarding the Determination of Recipients of Urgent Reparations to Restore the Rights of Human Rights Violations Victims, establishing that 245 identified victims will receive reparations. However, these recommendations are yet to be well implemented due to the absence of regulations to conduct the reparation and to bind the related institutions in providing such reparation. 

2. What solution are you proposing? 

1. A policy paper on TRC from civil society to provide recommendations which can help the development of policies regarding efforts to resolve past gross human rights violations This policy paper will be prepared with the active involvement of victims and experts and from the results of discussions gathered at the national and regional levels (Aceh, Papua). It is hoped that this policy paper can serve as input for the contents of the RUU KKR and its supporting documents (such as the Academic Paper or “Naskah Akademik”) prepared by the government, especially by providing victims' perspectives and views from experts. Additionally, this policy paper also serves to educate the public regarding gross human rights violations that have occurred in the past. 

2. RUU KKR Academic Paper from the Government The presence of a TRC law can become a basis for disclosing the truth about past gross human rights violations and fulfilling the right to truth for victims. The TRC’s work can also serve as an educational material for the public and state apparatus so that similar incidents will not reoccur in the future. The drafting of RUU KKR has gone through a series of discussions and will be included in the Regulatory Framework of the Government Work Plan (RKP) for 2023, but it does not have the supporting Academic Paper required for drafting and passing a Law. Therefore, this proposal encourages the preparation of the Academic Paper on the RUU KKR so that the process of drafting RUU KKR can proceed to a further stage. The drafting of the Academic Paper should be done with meaningful public involvement, especially from victims’ communities and civil society who are actively engaged in this issue. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? 1. A policy paper on TRC from civil society as one of the basic ideas for the birth of a policy to resolve past gross human rights violations. 2. Drafting process of the Academic Paper for RUU KKR involving public participation.

Commitment Analysis 

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? This commitment is relevant to the values of transparency because it encourages the establishment of truth-seeking mechanisms, which can be the basis for fulfilling victims' rights to truth and reparation. It can also help the public to learn the truth about Indonesia’s past and encourage institutional reform. 

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? This commitment helps foster the government’s accountability in providing human rights to its citizens, including human rights violation victims, and in making sure such violations do not reoccur in the future. This commitment also encourages the government to acknowledge that the past gross human rights violations occurred. 

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? Citizen participation is encouraged through the active involvement of the community in providing input for the drafting of the RUU KKR. The CSOs that propose this proposal will gather input from the victim community, experts and other civil society to ensure that there is wider participation and perspective in the drafting process. In addition, Tifa Foundation, KontraS Aceh and Yayasan Indonesia untuk Kemanusiaan will conduct education and campaigns to reach the public, especially youth, to find out information about past incidents of violence and gross human rights violations.

Key actions in the legislation will include: Substantial updating/modernisation of the legislation based on international best practice Extension of FOI to all public bodies as a default with limited exceptions as set out in the Bill bringing long-established high profile exclusions from FOI within remit; and to significantly funded bodies to enhance accountability of such bodies Removal of the up-front application fee Restoration of the main amendments to FOI introduced in 2003 which significantly restricted and curtailed the scope of Ireland's FOI regime. This includes reversal of the very wide definition of Government introduced in 2003, restoration of the strict definition of what constitutes a Cabinet record, communications between members of Government will no longer be exempt from FOI; restoration to the original five years of the ten-year prohibition on the release of Cabinet records; provision for some liberalisation of the mandatory ‘class’ exemption put in place in 2003 in relation to diplomatic communications and defence matters; where a commercial state body provides a service under a contract to a public body subject to FOI, the records relating to that service will be subject to FOI etc.

Objective: Strengthen the quality and quantity of potential Open Data sets by investing in data systems, people, standards, unique identifiers and processes. Status quo: There is much room to improve data infrastructure across the public sector. While some bodies have world class systems for their own purposes, other systems are aged, having suffered from a lack of new investment since the on-set of the recession. With a few notable exceptions, systems are generally not built to effectively share data or easily produce Open Data sets to the highest standards. Ambition: The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) will work with DSP, Revenue, DJEI, CSO and other stakeholders to develop the concept of a National Data Infrastructure, including the initiation of pathfinder projects that will demonstrate the value of linking data from multiple sources. One of the objectives of this work will be to facilitate better sharing and a stronger analytics capability through the use of individual, business and location identifiers. Aligned with this, Data Sharing and Governance legislation will be enacted. The central aim will be to ensure an integrated / cohesive approach in terms of information flows between and within public organisations while ensuring best practice in regard to privacy, security and data protection. The OGCIO, supported by the ICT Advisory Board and Heads of Civil Service HR and PAS, will work with Human Resources staff to develop an ICT Human Resource Strategy. By aligning with the wider Civil Service HR Strategy and industry best practice, this strategy should result in better quality data infrastructure, and ultimately, more and better quality open data. The OGCIO will build on existing relationships and practice sharing with the most advanced data-enabled EU countries (specifically the Nordics and the Netherlands), taking advice as appropriate, to define the gap between Ireland and EU exemplars and identify strategies to make up the ground. In doing so, Ireland will seek to maximise our innovative use of data and our readiness for the European Single Market, and confirm that our operational, policy and legislative plans will establish Ireland as an eGovernment leader while maintaining compliance with Data Protection requirements.

Objective: To strengthen the legislative framework to prevent, investigate and respond to corruption in the public and private sectors. Status quo: A) The Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 was published in December 2015, and completed Second Stage in the Dáil in January 2016. The Bill aims to significantly enhance the existing framework for identifying, disclosing and managing conflicts of interest and minimising corruption risks, to achieve a shift towards a more dynamic and risk-based system of compliance and to ensure that the institutional framework for oversight, investigation and enforcement is robust and effective. This Bill consolidates the current legislative framework governing the ethical obligations of public officials and gives effect to the recommendations of the Mahon Tribunal. Among the key reforms of the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 were: the introduction of a Public Sector Standards Commissioner, with additional powers and resources, to replace the Standards in Public Office Commission and to oversee a reformed complaints and investigations process; the establishment in legislation of a set of integrity principles for all public officials; the strengthening of the legal obligation for public officials to disclose, as a matter of routine, actual and potential conflicts of interest, reinforced by a significant extension of the personal and material scope of disclosures for public officials and graduated disclosure requirements; the establishment of a more effective (IT-based) process for the submission of periodic statements of interests; the imposition of statutory prohibitions on the use of insider information, on the seeking by public officials of benefits to further their private interests, and on local elected representatives from dealing professionally with land in certain circumstances; and the establishment of a statutory board to address potential conflicts of interest as public officials take up roles in the private sector. B) The Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010 would benefit from consolidation and renewal, as has been recommended by the Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) and other evaluation bodies. 39 They have recently been reviewed with a view to being replaced by a new Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Bill. C) The mechanisms for appointing and overseeing the judiciary are somewhat dated and could be improved to prevent the opportunity for potential corruption. Ambition: A) Finalise and enact the Public Sector Standards Bill to put in place a framework which modernises, simplifies and streamlines the current legislative framework for ethics with a robust and effective institutional framework for oversight, investigation and enforcement. B) A new Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Bill will be published and enacted to replace the outdated and overlapping Prevention of Corruption Acts which date back to 1889. The new Bill will replace existing offences and supplement them with new offences including those which will incriminate trading in influence, intimidation, misuse of confidential information by a public official, and facilitating corruption. The Bill will clarify the liability of corporate bodies for offences. It will also extend the range of penalties available to a court when a person is convicted to include forfeiture of public office. C) The prevention of corruption in the judicial sector will be enhanced by reforms in governance and accountability by establishing a judicial council. The Judicial Council legislation will provide for the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee, the function of which will be to promote and maintain high standards of judicial conduct. In addition to investigating complaints into the conduct of individual judges, the Judicial Conduct Committee will also be given responsibility for preparing and submitting draft guidelines concerning judicial conduct and ethics to the Board of the Council, for adoption by the Council. It is also envisaged that the Judicial Conduct Committee would have a role in providing advice on judicial conduct and ethics, both in general terms and to individual judges.

Status Quo The Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 (the Act) sets the framework to provide transparency to the public on ""who is lobbying whom24 about what"". By regulating lobbying activity through registration and reporting requirements, the aim is to strengthen public confidence in politics and in the business of government, to increase the accountability of decision makers and to subject public policy making, and those who seek to influence it, to greater openness, transparency and to the potential for appropriate independent scrutiny. In light of a specific event25, the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) announced on 29th September 2020 that section 22 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 dealing with the cooling-off period for certain elected and public officials would be reviewed. Also, the opposition introduced two Private Members Bills:  Regulation of Lobbying (Post-Term Employment as Lobbyist) Bill 2020, introduced in the Dáil 4th November 2020 by the Labour Party.  Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2020, introduced in the Oireachtas (legislature) on the 19th November 2020 by the Sinn Féin Party. Second Stage of the Bill took place under Sinn Fein Private Members’ time on 24/25 November 2020. An amendment was agreed on the 24th November 2020 that the Bill would be deemed to be read a second time in 9 months’ time (24th August 2021) to allow consideration of the Standards in Public Office (SIPO) recommendations for the wider reform of lobbying, including the provisions of both Private Members Bills. In light of these events, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform requested a thorough and comprehensive review of the legislation. Note that the second statutory review of the operation of the Lobbying Act was published in January 2020. Under section 2 of the Lobbying Act, there is a requirement that the operation of the Act be reviewed every 3 years. 

Ambition To undertake a wide review of how the existing legislative foundation could be enhanced most effectively and efficiently; strengthening weakness which have been identified. 

Commitment description 

What is the public problem that the commitment will address? To address the public concerns about the operation of the lobbying Act in relation to the operation of the cooling-off period for certain elected and public officials (section 22 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015). 

What is the commitment? To undertake a wide ranging review of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 to assess the policy, legal and practical implications of a specific event and to undertake a wide review of how the existing legislative foundation could be further enhanced in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and to address any weaknesses that the process surfaces. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? The wide ranging review will encompass the operation of the cooling-off period for certain elected and public officials (section 22 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015). 

Describe what the intended impact of successful implementation will be? The wide ranging review will bring forward recommendations, which will then be brought to Government to draft the necessary amendments to the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 to commence the legislative process

Which Open Government value(s) does your commitment relate too? Value: Public Accountability and Transparency Theme: Anti-corruption 

Why is (and describe how) this commitment is relevant to the Open Government value(s)? Communication, dialogue and engagement are central to a well-functioning democracy. Interest groups, representative bodies, industry and civil society organisations, NGOs and third party professional lobbyists all provide crucial input and feedback to the political and public administration systems. It is important that this activity is transparent and open to public scrutiny as part of the proper checks and balances which mitigate any attempt to seek to exert undue or improper influence on the conduct of policy formulation, development and decision making. 

What United Nations Sustainable Development Goal26 does this commitment relate too27? . Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels Sub-goal 16.6: Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels

IE0058,Ireland,4,5,IRL,Europe,National,1,2023,2025,2,Make Government more transparent and accountable through development of a modernised ethics statutory framework,"To strengthen, modernise, simplify and streamline the statutory framework for ethics/standards in public office with a robust institutional framework for oversight, investigation and enforcement.",Strengthen Statutory Framework for Ethics in Public Office,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

To bring forward legislation to modernise and simplify the statutory framework for ethics in public office, with the aim of creating a ‘fit-for-purpose’, user-friendly regime that contributes to strengthening the public’s trust and confidence in public officials and the democratic process by enhancing transparency and accountability of elected and appointed public officials.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? Ireland’s current statutory regime for Ethics in public life (the Ethics Acts) dates originally from the mid- 1990’s As well as disclosing interests, this statutory framework provides that evidence of tax compliance must be furnished to the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO) by all members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Attorney General and appointees to senior office in public bodies. The legislation also requires the drawing up of codes of conduct for ordinary members of the Houses, for office holders (e.g. Ministers of the Government and Ministers of State) and for public servants. These codes are published by the Standards in Public Office Commission. Instances of potential gaps in the framework for ethics have become matters of public debate. Relevant recommendations of the Review of Structures and Strategies to Prevent, Investigate and Penalise Economic Crime and Corruption (the ‘Hamilton Report’), published in December 2020, also fall to be considered in the context of reform of the statutory framework. If, in due course, legislation is passed by the Oireachtas, elected and appointed public officials will be subjected to enhanced accountability and transparency obligations and procedures in order to help bring to light and address conflicts of interest issues and thereby support the public’s trust and confidence in public officials and the democratic process.

2. What are the causes of the problem? Minimising the risks arising from conflicts that can occur between the interests that public officials are elected/employed to represent and their personal interests is a challenge common to all public administrations. These conflicts are natural and, to a greater or lesser extent, the inevitable consequence of the fact that public officials occupy more than one social role. Ireland’s current statutory framework for addressing these conflicts of interest has a number of points that require attention: • there are separate regimes at national and local level in regard to ethics requirements; • lack of knowledge and understanding among public officials in regard to ethics requirements and rules that apply to them; • uncertainty regarding responsibilities for advice, development of guidelines and Codes of Conduct; • anomalies that may impact on the credibility of the ethics regime; • uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of penalties for persons who are found to have breached ethical requirements; • bureaucracy and effectiveness issues – processes are paper based and there are no review obligations. 

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? The 2015 Public Sector Standards Bill (the PSSB) represented Government’s initial proposals for a comprehensive overhaul of the Ethics regime. Introduced in January 2016, this legislative proposal was last discussed in the Dáil at Committee Stage in April 2017. As it had not completed the legislative process, it lapsed when the Dáil was dissolved in January 2020 in advance of that year’s General Election. The Government made a further commitment in the 2020 Programme for Government to ‘reform and consolidate the Ethics in Public Office legislation’. The Minister for Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform subsequently carried out a comprehensive review of the statutory framework for ethics in public life in 2021/2022. This review element’s included: • Review of the existing ethics legislative framework and reassessment of the 2015 Public Sector Standards Bill; • Review of the recommendations of relevant Tribunals of Inquiry; • Review of recommendations of the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO) based on operation of the current regime; • Review of current EU/International best practiceand; • Public Consultation - Consultations with various parties. This Review completed, a Report was submitted to the Government in December 2022. The Government approved the publication of the report and agreed to the preparation of draft legislation to reform the regime informed by the outcome of the Review. In line with this, the Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform is currently preparing a general scheme of legislation, using the lapsed 2015 Public Sector Standards Bill as the point of departure. The intention is to bring proposals for reform to Government for approval to publish by end quarter 1 2024. Engagement is ongoing with various stakeholders to ensure that a new statutory framework will be effective and efficient to implement/administer and that it effectively addresses the needs of the public.

2. What solution are you proposing? The Department is preparing legislative proposals to reform, up-date and consolidate Ireland’s legislative framework for standards in public life. The intention is to provide a uniform and values-based framework covering the ethical conduct of public officials, which will cover inter alia various situations of conflicts of interest such as; gifts and other advantages, and post-employment situations. This will include new statutory prohibitions on the use of insider information; seeking or accepting benefits (including gifts and favors etc.) to further private interests; and local elected representatives dealing professionally with land in certain circumstances. Under the proposal, the legal obligation for public officials to disclose as a matter of routine, actual and potential conflicts of interest that arise in the context of the performance of their duties will be strengthened. This will include shared definitions, previously agreed, applying at national and local level. In particular, greater consistency and certainty on the rules governing limits on the receipt of gifts and travel benefits by public officials will be clearly outlined. The intention is that this will be complemented by a more effective, streamlined and efficient process for the submission of periodic statements of interests, notably providing that no declaration (or nil statement) will be required unless there has been a significant change and a streamlined and improved complaints and investigations procedure. Statutory offences are envisaged for breach of obligations in relation to gifts; ad hoc disclosure, use of confidential information; tax compliance and periodic disclosure. It will also seek to provide for high quality and effective training for public officials on issues such as ethics, conduct in situations of conflicts of interest. Overhaul of the oversight structures, new responsibility for advice and guidance and significant streamlining of declaration processes are also envisaged. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? • An up-to-date, ‘fit-for-purpose’, easy to understand and user-friendly statutory framework for standards in public life that continues to ensure that conflicts between the public interest and private interests of public officials are regulated correctly, ensuring accountability and thereby contribute to the quality and efficacy of public administration. • A streamlined, improved and transparent investigations procedure. • A more effective and efficient process for the submission of periodic statements of interests. • Consolidated local and national ethics requirements ensuring accountability at all levels. • Enhanced knowledge and understanding among public officials with regard to ethics requirements and rules that apply to them. • Over-arching integrity principles established in legislation to apply to all public officials. • Enhanced transparency and public accountability that contributes to strengthening the trust of citizens in democracy and its institutions.

Commitment Analysis

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? Declarations of interests by senior elected and appointed officials would be published by SIPO. Private declarable interests (such as liabilities over certain thresholds and, as the case may be of interests of their spouse, civil partner or of a child of the person or his or her spouse) would also be disclosed confidentially to SIPO for review, but maintained on a confidential basis. Subject to data protection considerations, the declarations of interests by senior elected and appointed officials would be published and made available online by SIPO. This will help improve citizens’ access to information, whilst also making elected public officials more transparent to their electors.

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? An enhancement of legal obligation for public officials at national and local level to disclose as a matter of routine actual and potential conflicts of interest that arise in the context of the performance of their duties can foster greater accountability to the public and facilitate transparent monitoring and evaluation systems. Building on the existing regime, it is intended that there will be further statutory prohibitions on matters such as: the use of insider information; seeking or accepting benefits (including gifts and favours etc.) to further private interests; and local elected representatives dealing professionally with land in certain circumstances. This can also help reinforce accountability. 

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? Citizen participation underpins a thriving democracy. The legislative proposals are informed by the recommendations of the Review of the statutory framework for ethics in public life undertaken by the Department in 2021/2022. This Review included a public consultation process as well as consultations with various parties. As a result, it had access to up-to-date evidence to inform its policy and legislative recommendations. Responses were received inter alia from non-government organisations (NGOs) such as Transparency International Ireland. As previously stated, declarations of interest by senior elected and appointed officials would be more accessible to inter alia citizens, citizen groups and act as an incentive for them to proactively engage with Government.

The Access to Information (ATI) Act that was passed in 2002 and came into effect in 2004 is in need of review and amendment. A comprehensive review of the ATI Act was conducted in 2009-2011, and the Joint Select Committee (JSC) Report to Parliament was tabled in 2011, which made recommendations including the strengthening ATI Unit and extending the public interest test. However, there has been no action taken since 2011 to amend the ATI Act, or implement the recommendations in the JSC Report. The existing ATI system also has constraints including delays in responses to requests for information. 

What is the commitment? To amend the Access to Information (ATI) Act and strengthen the ATI system in Jamaica. 

How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? The commitment to amend the ATI Act, based on the JSC Report of 2011 and subsequent developments, and to strengthen the ATI system in Jamaica will improve the legal and regulatory framework and system for provision of information by the government to citizens, both proactively and in response to requests for information, in order to advance certain fundamental principles underlying the system of constitutional democracy, including governmental accountability, transparency, and public participation in decision-making. The actions to improve the existing ATI system, including capacity development and training for ATI officers, public education on the ATI system, improved guidelines for public bodies and ATI officers, strengthening of reporting mechanisms, and development of a proposal for the application of an online platform for making and tracking ATI requests, will improve the operation of the existing ATI system and reduce delays in response to ATI requests.

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? The commitment to amend the ATI Act and strengthen the ATI system in Jamaica is relevant to the following OGP values: 1. Access to Information: The amendments to the ATI Act and strengthening of the ATI system will improve the legal and regulatory framework for ATI and the operation of the ATI system, resulting in improved access to public information for citizens. The commitment will also strengthen the relationship between the Access to Information system and the Open Data system. 2. Civic Participation: The process to amend the ATI Act and regulations will include stakeholder consultations. The re-establishment of the ATI Advisory Stakeholder Committee will expand and strengthen the representation and role of civil society in the ATI reform process. 3. Public Accountability: The increased access to information will enable more effective monitoring of performance of government entities, projects and programmes. 

Additional information The commitment to amend the Access to Information (ATI) Act and strengthen the ATI system in Jamaica is aligned with:  The Government of Jamaica Open Data Policy (2021)  Data Protection Act (2020)  Vision 2030 Jamaica National Development Plan – National Outcome No. 6 Effective Governance, including National Strategy 6-1 Strengthen the Process of Citizen Participation in Governance, National Strategy 6-5 Strengthen Public Institutions to Deliver Efficient and Effective Public Goods and Services, and National Strategy 6-7 Strengthen Accountability and Transparency Mechanisms; National Outcome No. 11 A Technology-Enabled Society, including National Strategy 11-1 Integrate Science and Technology into All Areas of Development  Medium Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework (MTF) for the relevant three-year period  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions – Target 16.10 Ensure public access to information; Access to Information is also seen as playing a cross- cutting role, contributing towards the achievement of all seventeen SDGs;  Inter-American Convention Against Corruption of which Jamaica is a party and the Committee of Experts that guides the Mechanism for Follow-Up on the implementation of the Convention („MESICIC‟)in which Jamaica participates;  Lima Commitment, OAS VIII Summit of the Americas (2018) - Democratic Governance Against Corruption.

The plan recognizes that the current legal framework (issued in 2007) suffers from certain imbalances while the operational plan of the National Integrity System contains a commitment to review the legislation related to the protection of the right to access information. In addition, the Jordanian Government accepted a number of the Human Rights Universal Periodic Review recommendations in 2013 which stipulated the importance of revising the regulatory environment governing the right to access information. The enforcement of the law suffers from a general lack of associated procedures to the law. Furthermore, the current law is not the only legal tool that deals with access to information issues. As a result, there are technical and administrative difficulties related to the management of information across various public sector institutions. Main objective: Harmonize national legislation and policies concerning the right to access information with international standards and best practices.

It enables citizens to have access to public information that affect their lives and have the right to access. It is the cornerstone for establishing the basis of accountability and public participation in general. Ambition: The Jordanian Government aims to establish a set of stable policies in the area of access to information based on international best practices and standards.

Commitment Description
1 / 9 / 2018 - 30 / 6 / 2020
The State Minister for Institutional Development and the Office of the Governmental
Coordinator for Human Rights What is the public
problem that the
commitment will
address?
This commitment was developed to address the current situation of submitting complaints
about human rights violations in the public sector. The complaints process suffers from
the dispersion of mechanisms and receiving entities, the poor processing approaches, the
difficulty of follow-up processes and lack of ability to retrieve statistics. While the Office of
the General Coordinator for Human Rights represents the governmental body to receive
complaints (without a legislative framework), a group of CSOs and official human rights
organizations play the mediation role, communicating with the office of the Government›s
Coordinator on behalf of the complainant, (in writing or through phone calls), where the
absence of a clear and specific case-processing mechanism causes many to refrain from
submitting complaints.
What is the commitment?
This commitment seeks to promote a citizens’ right to submit complaints about violations
conducted against them in public sector institutions at no cost. Complaints about HR
violations will be available through the traditional methods and via a designated electronic
platform. The commitment also seeks to institutionalize the Office of the Governmental
Coordinator for Human Rights’ legislative and regulatory framework on the jurisdiction
to receive human rights violations complaints and subsequent referrals to competent
authorities. In addition, the commitment aims to raise public awareness on the use of this
mechanism and to share their feedback about it periodically. How will the commitment
contribute to solve the
public problem?
The presence of a legislative and regulatory framework and a unified mechanism to receive
complaints contributes to solving the problems of the dispersion of mechanisms, receiving
complaints, and poor processing approaches. It also facilitates the use of conventional
and unconventional pathways (via an electronic platform) without the need of in-person
presence, in addition to ensuring a qualified team receives complaints and refers them to the
competent authorities, in an easy and speedy fashion. It will also encourage the dissemination
of reports on received complaints and the processing of each, incentivizing those who
are abused to submit complaints, and to strengthen their confidence in governmental
administration to handle them properly. This would, in turn, enhance public accountability
practices and improve governmental performance in line with human rights.
Why is this commitment
relevant to OGP values?
This commitment reinforces the value of Public Accountability, as it relates to the notion
of human rights complaints in the public sector. It also establishes the access to relevant
information through periodic reporting on received complaints, which includes the numbers
and processing outputs, while maintaining the privacy of personal information. Furthermore,
it is in line with the value of technology and innovation for openness and accountability,
through the use of an electronic platform for filing complaints and other follow-up processes.
The commitment is consistent with the value of Civic Participation as well, since it requires
participatory actions gathering state and non-state actors throughout its implementation.
Additional information
This commitment is linked to the National Human Rights Strategy prepared by the Office
of the General Coordinator for Human Rights, and is linked to SDG 16, particularly subgoals
16.6 to « develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels»
and 16.3 to «promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure
equal access to justice for all».
This commitment comes as a continuation of the work on Commitment 4-(a) of Jordan’s
third NAP under OGP 20162018-, and has been designed based on progress evaluation.

Over the past years, the government has encouraged more public engagement through various means, including online tools. However, these efforts are not sustainable, structured, or available across all government entities and often fragmented. Citizens interested in commenting and providing opinions related to public policies and legislations must access different portals. Therefore, they may often miss some of them due to a lack of follow-up or systematic alerts. This in turn, decreases public participation. 

What is the commitment? This commitment seeks to unify and institutionalize e-participation within governmental institutions’ by building a unified national online portal that facilitates obtaining citizens’ opinions and develops the legal framework related to e-participation. This commitment is part of Jordan’s E-participation Policy (2021).

How will the commitment contribute to solve this public problem? Creating a unified national portal will facilitate and increase broader participation among citizens. Through this portal, citizens will not be forced to browse multiple portals from different government departments. They can voice their opinions in one window. Also, citizens will know that any consultation of the government will be available on this portal, which allows them to be well-informed and encourages them to participate. 

How is this commitment relevant to OGP values?(19) (1) This commitment is relevant to the value of civic participation because it adopts a participatory approach to developing government policies and procedures related to civil society organizations, in addition to enhancing citizens’ role in decision-making through participation in consultations on government projects and legislative proposals. (2) It is also relevant to the value of access to information as it includes the dissemination of information throughout the various stages of its implementation, in addition to the dissemination of policies and procedures that will be developed to ensure that citizens and civil society organizations have access to them. Furthermore, the information regarding government projects and legislation proposals will also be published. (3) It is also relevant to the value of public accountability as it enhances citizens’ follow-up with government projects and legislative proposals through the online portal, and the mechanism for consultations and taking citizens’ opinions into account. (4) This commitment is relevant to the value of openness for technology and innovation to increase accountability and transparency, as it contributes to enhancing citizens’ participation in the decision-making process in a transparent manner through the national portal for e-participation in innovative ways.

KE0027,Kenya,4,4,KEN,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Public Participation and Legislative Openness,Increase efforts to promote public participation in the legislative process,"We will strive to mainstream meaningful public participation and in all developmental spheres in the country, ensuring that the voice of the public counts and shapes the eventual developmental outcome for ownership. Additionally, we shall seek to boost legislative openness as part of the effort toward securing open and accountable governance. 

Objective To optimally actualize the constitutional aspiration on public participation, identified as a national value and principle of governance and a key requirement in legislative, economic and social development. 

Status quo The Constitution of Kenya, 2010 (COK, 2010), in Article 10, identifies public participation as one of the key national values and principles of governance. Via Article 118, COK, 2010 binds Parliament to engaging members of the public in its business. It requires Parliament to ‘facilitate public participation and involvement in the legislative and other business of Parliament and its committees.’ Despite being over a decade old provision, implementation of public participation largely remains sub-optimal, either completely ignored or half-heartedly implemented. A nationallevel legislation to refine its implementation is yet to be passed, thus confining the process largely to the zone of mere formality and tokenistic undertaking. It fails the test of inclusivity and genuine desire to incorporate the views as shared by members of the public. There is lack of robust and effective mechanisms of binding duty bearers to meaningful public participation process. Access to information, to inform optimal participation by the public, lacks optimal guarantee. 

Ambition Secure a framework to allow for meaningful public participation in the country’s governance ecosystem, in all its variations; political, economic and social. Further open up the Parliament and County Assemblies by ensuring that all proceedings, both plenary and committee, are availed to the public for comprehensive scrutiny and robust engagement with the country’s law making system and regime. This is in furtherance of legislative openness in keeping with the 2012 ‘Declaration on Parliamentary Openness’ which in part provides that ‘parliamentary openness enables citizens to be informed about the work of parliament, empowers citizens to engage in the legislative process, allows citizens to hold parliamentarians to account and ensures that citizens’ interests are represented.’ By seeking to secure the place of civic education, focus shall also be trained on empowering and equipping the public with requisite capacity to meaningfully engage with and in public participation spaces and engender in them the consciousness to ensure that their voices count in the best way possible.

KE0033,Kenya,5,2,KEN,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2023,2027,4,NA,Digital Governance,Safe and Responsible Digital Transformation,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

The Commitment seeks to promote ethical, safe, inclusive, responsible and human rights-centered digital transformation and services to citizens through meaningful participation. The commitment aims to establish inclusive, safe, and responsible secure digital transformation mechanisms, develop public trust through policy, and safeguard human rights and freedoms in the provision of digital services.

Problem Definition 

The commitment primarily aims to address exclusion in digital services and the digital divide. This policy problem is of significant relevance to the Kenyan national context because, as services continue to transition into the digital realm, there is a looming risk that certain segments of the population may be left behind. This digital exclusion could perpetuate historical inequalities and further marginalize vulnerable groups within the country. As of January 2023, there were 17.86 million internet users in Kenya with internet penetration at 32.7 percent. Kenya has 10.55 million social media equating to 19.3 per cent of the total population. Also, the country recorded 63.94 million cellular mobile connections equivalent to 117.2 percent of the total population. There are also 32.1 million feature phones and 30.7 smartphones. As part of digital transformation efforts, the government has launched 5,000 services on its eCitizen platform, with an ambition of 12,000 by the end of 2023. While these digital systems are complimented by in-person services, the rapid pace of change of technology, means that those who require services enabled by technology will not be assured of good quality or efficient services. The commitment, therefore, aims to address the issue of exclusion of a majority of people, especially women, youth, persons with disability and marginalized communities from Kenya's ongoing digital transformation journey, which is particularly relevant to the country as services become increasingly digital. This exclusion could further limit their access to digital services and exacerbate existing opportunity disparities. The issue is taking place nationwide and has likely persisted as digital transformation efforts have not always factored in their needs and the digital divide. It is crucial to address this ongoing problem to ensure equitable participation in the digital age while reducing historical inequalities. These complex challenges to Kenya's digital transformation journey highlights the urgent need to revise and augment the existing policy framework, foster a broader understanding of digital technology's transformative potential, address financial dependencies, and implement inclusive digital governance measures. Additionally, Kenya must navigate the intricate landscape of emerging technologies, ensure safety and security, promote public trust, and advocate for a global governance system that aligns with the rapid pace of technological advancement. These multifaceted issues demand innovative, participatory and multistakeholder approaches to digital governance to propel Kenya toward a more inclusive and prosperous digital future. 

What are the causes of the problem? 

Kenya grapples with several challenges on its path toward achieving inclusive digital governance. The existing policy environment lacks a strong focus on inclusivity, impeding equitable access of citizens to digital opportunities and services, particularly within a technologically advanced service delivery framework. This issue is exacerbated by the fragmented approach policy implementation and in the design, adoption, and utilization of technology, along with a limited capacity on the understanding and implementation of digital technologies as enablers for development. Moreover, rising cyber threats and the impact of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) raise valid concerns related to safety and security, and could potentially impact public trust in digital systems. Furthermore, existing governance structures at both the national, regional and global levels grapple with the task of adapting to the fast pace of technological change. Decision-makers are also stuck to traditional, linear thinking on policy and decision-making matters, which may not align with the disruptive non-linear forces of innovation or becoming too engrossed in immediate concerns, which may hinder their ability to strategically address the transformative dynamics shaping our future. Also, while access to the internet and digital devices is increasing, the country has a growing digital divide that could widen digital exclusion. 

Commitment Description 

In 2022, the Kenyan Government initiated a 10-year digital master plan with the goal of enhancing citizen access through digital technologies. This encompassed various initiatives like fiber connectivity, ICT hubs, free Wi-Fi, and digital skills training. Simultaneously, the government undertook the digitization of 12,000 services to boost efficiency and minimize bias. To keep pace with rapid technological changes, a working group on policy and legislative reforms was formed within the Ministry of Information and the Digital Economy in September 2023. This group is working towards ensuring a flexible regulatory environment that fosters innovation while upholding essential safeguards. These efforts are expected to yield positive outcomes by reducing issues such as bribery through decreased human interaction and the adoption of digital payments. Additionally, they have improved accessibility by reducing the distance to service points. However, one challenge remains: achieving inclusivity in the service design. 

Proposed Solutions 

Intervention I: Establish a coordination mechanism for digital transformation (Multi Stakeholder, inclusive and independent from government) 
Intervention II: Develop data governance frameworks and guidelines to inform safe ,secure and responsible digital transformation 
Intervention III: Support the development of a policy on safe, secure and responsible adoption and use of digital technologies such as Emerging Technologies and Artificial Intelligence (Ai) to increase public trust. 
Intervention IV: Contribute to the development of the Public Participation Bill, 2023 on safeguarding of human rights and fundamental freedoms online (freedom of speech, privacy, association and safety, internet shutdowns, etc.) 
Intervention V: Enhance open channels for meaningful citizen engagement and feedback on digital services and policies, allowing citizens to voice their concerns and needs. 

Desired Results 

 A well-coordinated, inclusive, responsive mechanism for digital transformation  Framework and guidelines developed for safe and secure use of emerging technologies, and recommendations reflected in policies and laws  Safe, secure and responsible adoption and use of digital technologies  Increased public trust in the adoption and use of digital technologies.  Enhanced public participation and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms online  An empowered and engaged citizenry, leveraging accurate information within a digital environment that ensures online rights, safety, and freedoms.  Enhanced public trust as a result of delivering citizen-centric digital services that address the genuine needs and concerns of citizens.

KE0034,Kenya,5,3,KEN,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2023,2027,4,NA,Open Data for Development,Open Data for Development,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

To make available, in machine-readable format and with appropriate licensing, all data on financial resource management, implementation, planning and monitoring of government programs, projects and processes to strengthen accountability and improve evidence-informed decision-making to ensure that we leave none behind.

Problem Definition 

Data needed for strengthening accountability, improving transparency, planning and measuring progress of implementation of programs, projects and processes in government is not easily available or usable. This creates an environment for perpetuation of corrupt practices, insufficient evidence to support decision making and inefficient use of human, financial and other resources in the public sector. Ultimately, citizens and the general public are affected due to the failure to implement key infrastructure projects effectively and in many instances failures in service delivery. This commitment therefore aims to address the lack of data for development which makes it difficult to strengthen accountability and ensure that policies/programmes being implemented do not result in some within the society being left behind. 

Causes of the problem 

Three fundamental challenges persist in the effort to make data available for transparency, accountability, public engagement, and decision-making: a poor enabling environment, limited capacity for data development, and inadequate access to the necessary infrastructure. 

Low Capacity: The insufficient availability of critical data for promoting transparency, accountability, public participation, and evidence-based decision-making poses a substantial threat to the successful delivery of services and the implementation of projects and programs. In the 2022 edition of the Global Data Barometer, Kenya's performance in the Capability theme was notably subpar. This theme evaluates the extent to which effective data creation, management, and utilization capacity is in place. These capacities are essential for stakeholders to generate fresh insights based on evidence and rely on factors such as accessibility, skills, infrastructure, institutional support, and intermediaries. Kenya received a score of 30, which fell below the global average of 49. Furthermore, Kenya received a zero rating for subnational capabilities, open data initiatives, and support for data reuse. The country also garnered a very low rating regarding civil service training for data—a critical aspect in ensuring that institutions and their information officers can effectively respond to information access requests and manage data and data portals. 

Poor Enabling Environment: Despite efforts that trace back to the inception of the Kenya Open Data Initiative, challenges persist in accessing data related to enacted budgets and their execution. In the 2021 edition of the Open Budget Survey, Kenya's transparency score remained stagnant in the range of 48% to 50% over the past five years. One of the primary recommendations is for the government to enhance the comprehensiveness of the Enacted Budget. The situation could be significantly improved by publishing budget data as a distinct dataset. Regrettably, there is no legal mandate requiring the government to take this step, leading to the unavailability of these datasets unless non-governmental entities extract them from PDF documents and publish them on third-party websites. This approach risks introducing typographical errors during the transcription process and results in a lack of government ownership over these datasets. Consequently, confidence in the accuracy of the datasets is low, and their utility is limited.. 

Lack of Infrastructure: Possessing data on socio-economic indicators and budget execution, while valuable, does not, on its own, guarantee an inclusive society. In addition to the appropriate disaggregation and statutory requirements, spatial data and information enable planners and other stakeholders to understand the geographical allocation of resources and services concerning the population distribution. The essential remote sensing data and satellite imagery required for this form of planning have remained costly to obtain, store, manage, and use. As a result, this data largely remains beyond the reach of government officers and stakeholders due to a lack of accessible and affordable infrastructure, as well as insufficient skills and financial resources. While the government, through the Kenya Space Agency, has deployed a satellite to make some remote sensing data and imagery accessible, it is vital to ensure that this data is within reach. Nevertheless, without affordable and accessible infrastructure in place, these resources would remain inaccessible for government ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) as well as county governments.

Commitment Description 

In 2011, Kenya launched the Kenya Open Data Initiative (KODI) as the 2nd such effort by an African country. A key objective was to make data held by the government accessible to the general public under an open license to catalyze innovation and support transparency and accountability. The KODI portal (Opendata.go.ke) however has been offline for the last few years despite efforts to revive the initiative due to lack of a legal framework, lack of clarity on the institution where such an initiative should be domiciled and consequently lack of domestic resources. The passing of the Public Finance Management Act 2012 brought with it a requirement for the government to publish all the documents related to the budget process such as the budget and the budget execution reports. While these are available on the websites of the National Treasury and the Office of the Controller of Budget, they are difficult to extract data from thereby impeding the objective to improve transparency and accountability. Where county data and statistics are concerned, there have been two efforts to enact a County Statistics Act. However, the bill has failed to pass through the Senate leaving county governments with no overarching legal framework for county statistics. In 2022, an effort to address the civil service training gap on data was implemented by the Commissioner for Access to Information and the Kenya School of Government through the development and adoption of a curriculum on Access to Information. This curriculum includes a module on open data, but it does not address issues of standards, interoperability or guidance on infrastructure. A revision to the curriculum is therefore necessary 

Proposed Solutions 

a. Statutory interventions - Amendment to the public finance management legislation to mandate publication of budget and expenditures data in machinereadable format with a prescribed level of disaggregation and a standard/ harmonized reporting format to enable data interoperability esp. at the subnational level. Enactment of a County Statistics Act to provide a legal framework for county governments to implement statistics units for collection of data and production of statistics to inform policy, programmes and projects. b. Adoption of standards and norms for data production, data portals and data dissemination, particularly to strengthen geospatial and gender data, through development of a guidebook for public sector institutions, including county governments to ensure data is interoperable, appropriately disaggregated (especially by gender, age and administrative units where appropriate) c. Capacity development through institutionalized training for government officers carried out in the context of the Access to Information Act 2016 to ensure officers have the requisite skills and understanding to prepare, license and publish interoperable data disaggregated appropriately. d. Establishment of a Data Governance Council that will champion the development and implementation of a plan to make targeted improvements to human capital, infrastructure and financing for data informed by an assessment e. Implementation of standards compliant and interoperable portals to improve access to remote sensing & satellite data, budget data and administrative data to support accountability and evidence informed decision making. 

Desired Results 

a. Enhanced capacity of Government officers to process and publish open data for use by other MDAs and the general public thereby increasing access and improving quality of data for decision making. 
b. An increase in the amount of data available as open data on resource allocation, utilization, results and planning, including data that enables implementation and monitoring of programmes and processes to ensure they are responsive to the challenges facing women and girls. 
c. Enactment of legislation to strengthen the enabling environment for data and statistics as well as the adoption of guidance to improve disaggregation (particularly gender, geography and age) and interoperability of data and data infrastructure. 
d. Increased access to affordable and accessible infrastructure within government for collecting, storing, processing and publishing of data on resource allocation and resource use as well as GIS data for spatial planning. 
e. Improved transparency and accountability in governance, resource management and public service delivery due to improved availability of data. 
f. The emergence of strengthened inclusive and informed participation by the general public in decision making on socio-economic programmes/projects driven by better access to evidence. 

Commitment Analysis 

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? The requirement for the provision of Open Data in machine readable formats and with an appropriate prescribed minimum level of disaggregation will promote transparency and improve access to data and information on budgets, expenditures and GIS information. 

2. How will commitment help foster accountability? That citizens will have increased access to data for interrogation and evidence to track progress on programs, projects and processes. The public will be able to have access to the information on progress and have a basis for reference and questioning of the utilization of public funds. 

3. How will commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? When citizens can readily access data and information as needed, it will promote well-informed public engagement and empower individuals, fostering a greater sense of agency. This is especially vital for enabling evidence-based contributions throughout the policy development process and assisting them in comprehending the status of budget execution, program implementation, and project progress.

KE0038,Kenya,5,7,KEN,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2023,2027,4,NA,Access to Information,Strengthening Access to Information,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

The commitment seeks to ensure the effective implementation of the Access to Information Act, No. 31 of 2016, for the realization of citizens’ right of access to information. It further seeks to strengthen the existing regulatory framework on Access to Information and leverage technology to enhance disclosure of information and promote effective records management.

Problem Definition 

The Development of the National Access to Information Policy seeks to provide legislative guidance for the effective implementation of the Access to Information Act, No. 31 of 2016 ( ATI Act, 2016). The ATI Act was not sponsored by the Executive and therefore its development was not preceded by a Policy as is the norm in the majority of legislative instruments initiated by the Executive. The importance of developing a policy framework first is intended to amongst other salient features allow the executors to determine a clear road map, conduct an assessment of the problem and possible solutions, and define the opportunity to be embraced and the modalities or approaches to realize the benefit prior to proposing the necessary legal framework. This is essential to ensure that the law is properly understood, uniformly applied, and effectively promotes transparency and accountability. Other challenges brought by the lack of a national ATI policy include inconsistency and incoherency in government policies on information disclosures, inadequate resource allocation, and lack of enabling procedures and infrastructure. The challenge affects citizens, civil society organisations, and government officials ability to exercise the right of information as well as fulfill statutory duties on the part of government officials. 

The adoption of the model Access to Information Law by at least Four Counties targeting OGP Local Counties), seeks to decentralize the national access to information framework and encourage its awareness, adoption and effective implementation at the local level. Communities, media, local organizations, and government officials in the selected counties will benefit from a strengthened access to information framework allowing citizens access to relevant information about their lives, critical services and will facilitate their participation in governance while holding the county governments to account.

The Development of Reporting Guidelines for Public and Private Entities on ATI The ATI Act obligates public entities and relevant private bodies to provide the Commission with reports required under the Act with respect to the implementation thereof. The Act additionally under Section 23(7) confers on the Commission the power to develop and publicize guidelines in consultation with the public detailing the reporting requirements including the manner, means and timeframes that apply to public entities and relevant private bodies. The objective of this milestone to guide public entities and private bodies (duty bearers) in compliance with their reporting obligations under the Act, provide for modalities of submitting annual reports to the Commission and administrative sanctions to be met by the Commission for non-compliance with reporting obligations and to provide for feedback mechanisms by the Commission to public entities & relevant private bodies upon assessment and evaluation of the reports. All these will serve to enhance the Commission’s capacity to implement the ATI Act. 

Strengthening administrative action by the media to effectively use the Access to Information Act for the delivery of accurate information, combating misinformation and disinformation and creating public awareness of OGP. This milestone aims to empower journalists and media practitioners to effectively use the Access to Information Act to seek and deliver accurate information, combat misinformation and disinformation, and also raise public awareness about the Open Government Partnership (OGP). Journalists, media organizations, and the general public are affected by the spread of misinformation and disinformation, particularly during critical events like elections, pandemics, natural disasters, etc. The problem of false information has intensified with the advent of the digital age, requiring a proactive approach to mitigate it. In addition, diminishing trust in media and shrinking media freedom aggravate the problem. 

The Development of a Framework for the Digitization of Public Records under Section 17 of the ATI Act. The provision seeks to modernize record-keeping and information management within the public sector, making government data more accessible and manageable in line with Kenya’s National Digital Master Plan 2022-2032. The problem of outdated and inaccessible public records, including challenges with the inefficiency of info management, retrieval and sharing among inter-agency has been persistent and has hindered effective access to information including that which concerns matters of life and liberty. These can be improved for efficiency in task load. To address these challenges, we will develop a framework that will provide national standards for the computerization of public records in line with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and in international best practice as envisioned in Section 17 of the ATI Act. Citizens, government officials, and organizations relying on public records will greatly benefit from this initiative. 

Increase Awareness and uptake of the Access to Information Course at the Kenya School of Government and Broaden the Base of Participants to include Private Sector Information Officers. The Commission in partnership with the Kenya School of Government developed an ATI curriculum targeting public officers involved in processing of access to information requests in public entities to equip them with knowledge, skills and competences to implement the legal framework on access to information. By broadening the base of participants to include private sector information officers, this milestone aims to enhance the understanding and application of the Access to Information Act which mandates both public and relevant private entities to proactively disclose information to the citizens. The lack of awareness of their role and mandate in providing this information has been a major hindrance due to a strong culture of secrecy and ignorance of the law amongst duty bearers. The problem of limited knowledge and capacity to utilize the Act has impacted both those seeking access to information and information officers. 

Enhancing Proactive Disclosure of Information by Key Stakeholders across the Electoral Cycle to address a recurring problem related to political transparency, accountability and public participation. Kenya’s electoral process has often been a charged affair, marred by concerns over credibility, transparency, accountability coupled with inadequate information infrastructure, and a lack of willingness by key actors to provide relevant information for accountability purposes. Since the adoption of the 2010 Constitution, Kenya has conducted three general elections—in 2013, 2017 (including a repeat presidential poll), and 2022. These elections have been marked by significant legal disputes and varying levels of civil conflict sparked by allegations wanting credibility, transparency, and accountability. The inadequate information infrastructure to manage the electoral process, and an unwillingness by state actors to provide information for those seeking accountability has resulted in public trust deficit and unrest. The crucial role of transparency and the right to information in safeguarding peace, security, and stability within the electoral context, therefore, is undeniable.

What are the causes of the problem? 

● Culture of Secrecy: A significant factor contributing to the issue is the entrenched culture of secrecy within the government. Public officials habitually withhold information that should be accessible to the public. This culture of secrecy prevents citizens from holding the government accountable and participating in governance, even though the Access to Information Act mandates public entities to proactively disclose information. The root cause here is a historical and systemic lack of transparency and openness within government institutions, perpetuating a culture of secrecy that impedes progress. 
● Lack of Structure and Standards: The absence of structured processes and standards for digitizing government records is another critical issue. This deficiency hinders the effective organization and accessibility of information. The root cause can be traced back to an absence of comprehensive policies and standards for managing government records in a digital age. 
● Low Awareness of ATI: There is a lack of awareness among both public officials and citizens regarding their rights and obligations under the Access to Information Act. When both parties are unaware of their roles and responsibilities, the public's right to access information is impeded. This lack of awareness stems from limited educational efforts and the historical disregard for the importance of open government practices. 
● No Uniform Government Approach: Inconsistencies in the government's approach, processes, and procedures for disclosing information exacerbate the problem. The absence of uniformity in government information disclosure protocols results from a lack of comprehensive guidelines, which can be attributed to a lack of emphasis on standardization in the past. 
● Inconsistent Policies and Inadequate Resources: There are inconsistencies and incoherencies in government policies on information disclosure. The problem is compounded by inadequate resources, lack of enabling procedures, and infrastructure, resulting from a historical failure to prioritize information management and transparency. 
● Challenges During Elections: During elections, limited access to online spaces further complicates the issue. Root causes include inadequate digital infrastructure and barriers to online access during critical electoral periods. 
● Low Trust in Media: The diminishing trust in media and shrinking media freedom aggravate the problem. The historical issues related to media credibility and freedom within Kenya's socio-political context are the root causes of this challenge. 
● Limited Awareness and Implementation of Accessibility Guidelines: Limited awareness and implementation of accessibility guidelines, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), indicate the need for comprehensive awareness standards and regulatory enforcement, with the root cause being a historical lack of emphasis on digital accessibility. 

Commitment Description 

The promulgation of Kenya’s constitution in 2010 opened a new chapter for Access to Information in Kenya. Article 35 of the ‘new’ constitution now guaranteed every citizen the right to access information. However, it was until September 21, 2016, that life was breathed into this article through the enactment of the Access to Information Act and the subsequent Gazettement of ATI Regulations. Since then, there have been concerted multi stakeholder efforts geared at socializing this constitutional provision. These have included the development and the roll-out of the Curriculum on Access to Information for Journalists in Eastern Africa in 2022 in addition to the ATI Curriculum for public officers entrenched at the Kenya School of Government in 2020. There have also been innovative programs like the development of the Model County law on ATI and the simplification of ATI Toolkits for media and citizens. Capacity building and awareness creation initiatives of ATI amongst duty bearers and rightsholders have also been progressed. The most recent development has been the finalization of the National ICT Policy in 2019 and the Gazettement of the Standards on Accessibility of ICT Products in 2022. 

Proposed Solutions 

● Overarching policy framework on ATI 
● Enhanced capacity building on ATI for government, private sector, media and citizens
● Inclusion and strengthening the capacity of media to help them fulfill their role of providing quality and reliable information. 
● Enhanced accountability framework for public entities and private bodies in reporting 
● Broadened base of stakeholders meaningfully participating in OGP and open government processes 
● Enhanced electoral integrity and citizen access of digital spaces during elections 

Desired Results 

Proactive disclosure of information by government and relevant private institutions Empowered citizens to obtain information held by public bodies Available and easily accessible information to citizens to enhance their participation in governance issues Enhanced oversight and enforcement capacity of the oversight institution on access to information Digitization of government records to facilitate access to information and to act as a catalyst to the digital transformation of government processes. 

Commitment Analysis

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? Access to information will foster evidence-based engagement between the government and citizens. It will also oblige the government to make public data regarding the utilization of public funds readily accessible for scrutiny. 

2. How will commitment help foster accountability? Since citizens can easily access information from public entities, they can hold public entities accountable based on the information they get Citizens will have the leeway to interrogate/scrutinize the government based on the information that government provides especially in the utilization of public funds through projects, processes and development programs and in the process enhance accountability. 

3. How will commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? Ensuring information and services are accessible to all, including those with disabilities or from marginalized communities, thereby enhancing inclusive and broadbased participation. Overall, this commitment creates an ecosystem of transparency, awareness, and engagement. Citizens will be better equipped to participate in defining solutions that align with their needs, actively engage in the implementation process, and monitor the progress made.

Public procurement in Kosovo has continuous improvements every year, especially now that the e-Procurement platform is increasingly advancing. However, in the parts where the human factor is still needed, there are limps. The continuous violations of the law by the procurement officials and the few punishments are causing a situation where the goal of the Public Procurement Law (PPL), that is to have efficient procurement, is not being achieved. E-procurement is a partially open Public Procurement system.

What is the commitment? Fully open system of public procurement and open contracting. 

How does the commitment contribute to solving the identified problem? Opening up data related to all levels of public procurement (from pre-tender stage, tender stage and post-tender stage onwards) in a machine-readable format makes public procurement open and transparent, so that individuals or certain groups enjoy easy access to information. 

Why is it important to commit to the values of OGP? Access to machine-readable information is about good governance, openness, transparency and accountability in spending public money and increasing the well-being of citizens and improving public services.

Lack of transparency, accountability and financial control of political parties registered in the Republic of Kosovo. 

What is the pledge? Increasing transparency, accountability and financial control of political parties registered in the Republic of Kosovo

How does the pledge contribute to solving the identified problem? The Republic of Kosovo has a legal basis which enables registered political parties to have an annual public fund and also to be financed by donations from citizens and legal entities. Also, during the election processes, political parties benefit from the public fund, donations from citizens and legal entities for the development of election campaigns at the central and local level. Although this is regulated on a legal basis, the Republic of Kosovo has not yet managed to strengthen the mechanisms for increasing transparency, accountability and full control of the finances of political parties. Every year, about 4 million euros are allocated from the state budget for the political parties represented in the Assembly of Kosovo.

Why is it important to commit to the values of OGP? The creation of these mechanisms is in accordance with the values of the OGP to promote transparency, accountability, effective and regular control and citizen access to the way of spending the finances of political parties in the Republic of Kosovo. 

Description of expected results: Political parties registered in the Republic of Kosovo are transparent, accountable, controlled and open for citizens to have access to spending their finances.

Commitment description
What is the public problem that the commitment will address?	The Global Right to Information ranking data for Kyrgyzstan for 2015 indicates gaps in the legislation on access to information (http://www.rti-rating.org/view_country?country_name=Kyrgyzstan#right).
The Law on Access to Information provides no comprehensive list of data subject to disclosure for public access thus allowing government agencies to manipulate the information disclosure issues. There are also no criteria for classifying information as confidential/limited access and requirements to publish reasoned justification for limiting access to information. This significantly limits citizens’ ability to access information of the state bodies.
What is the commitment?	As part of this commitment, it is planned to reform the legislation on access to information and develop clear criteria for classifying information as confidential or limited access, in accordance with the international standards.
It is also planned to introduce a monitoring mechanism for fulfillment of the legislation requirements by the state bodies in the field of access to information, in terms of disclosing information maintained by the state bodies and local governments. Based on monitoring results, transparency rating of state and municipal authorities will be formed.
How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem?	A clear division of restricted access information with the rest of information administered by state and municipal authorities will improve citizens' access to state and municipal authorities’ information.
Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?	Transparency: Citizens will get better access to the state and municipal bodies’ information

Commitment description
What is the public problem that the commitment will address?	In accordance with the Resource Management Index 2017, important data at the license level is not published systematically and in full by the mining industry of the Kyrgyz Republic. Thus, supervisor bodies and citizens do not have enough data to ensure accountability of the government, local authorities and companies. The publication of insufficient data, especially in the field of environmental protection, is one of the reasons for the ongoing conflicts in areas of subsoil use between the local communities and mining companies.
What is the commitment?	Ensuring regular publication of the mining industry relevant data at the license level with necessary detailed explanations.
How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem?	Systematic publication of the mining industry relevant data at the license level will assist the Kyrgyz Republic in:
1) Partial reduction of conflicts and distrust in areas of subsoil use.
2) Increasing capacity of parliamentarians and citizens to conduct official and public oversight of the state, local governments and companies.
3) Ensuring discussions between parliamentarians, civil sector and the government on evidence-based mining industry thus preventing populist decisions.
Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?	Transparency: Citizens will have access to key data of the mining industry

Citizen participation: Citizens will have the opportunity to exercise oversight, analysis and participation in decision-making on mining industry projects

LV0040,Latvia,4,1,LVA,Europe,National,1,2019,2021,2,NA,Transparency in Public Procurement and Contracts,Transparency in Public Procurement and Contracts,"What are the major national and societal challenges that this commitment will address?
There is mistrust in the public about the fairness and usefulness of public procurement results. This disbelief is exacerbated by cases of purchasers acting for selfish purposes on goods,services paid too high for construction work, the quality obtained does not match the price. To multiplypublic confidence in the effective management of State and local authorities by the budget and the European Union Financial means should seek new and effective methods of monitoring procurement, including through promotionpublic participation in procurement monitoring.The Integrity Pact is an increasing use of public procurement surveillance and corruption in Europetool for prevention. It is also supported and promoted by the European Commission. Under its leadership, the Integrity Pact was introduced in 11 EU Member States as a monitoring tool for EU-funded projectssupport. There is a convenient and comprehensive identification of potential risks for certain procurersboth procurement supervisors are needed to build risk analysisa sample of purchases to be audited, as well as members of the public, to strengthen civilian oversight over theprocurement process and public demand for state and municipal institutions to improve their ownperformance in public procurement. At present, the collection of various risk factors must be done manually gathering information from various sources. By digitizing procurement risk assessment,using the Procurement Information published on the Procurement Monitoring Bureau websitenotices and decisions of the Review Panel, interested parties would be giventhe ability to analyze information and select customers to focus on purchasing behaviorincreased attention.Although all procurement contracts and their amendments are published in the Electronic Procurement Systemwww.eis.gov.lv in the profile created for each purchase (contract texts are appended to .pdf or .docxformat), but no structured and easy-to-read information about the contract is availableexecution from the moment of its completion to full execution. It limits the oversight body, non-governmental opportunities for organizations and the public to find out about actual public spendingprocurement contracts, compare contract prices and planned and actual contract deadlines, identify risks of unjustified expenditure.There are contract registers in several Member States of the European Union where information oncontracts, their modification and actual performance, and information is also available in the opendata by publishing it on national open data portals.Information on public-law contracts providing for the provision of public or local funding can not be found for delegated or delegated management tasksin one place. In accordance with the Public Administration Structure Law, information on delegation agreements and Contribution agreements should be published on the website of the delegating authority.This makes it difficult for the public to easily and easily get to know what administrations are in one place tasks delegated to individuals; and on public funding provided for in the terms of delegationaward. The implementation of this commitment will be used in 2018 by the national regulatory authorities results of the internal audit of the Delegation of Public Administration Tasks by the Audit Bodies.

What is the commitment?
The following measures will be taken to promote greater transparency in public procurement and contracts: 
1. Structured publication of descriptive data on the performance of procurement contractsUsing information from announcements posted on the Procurement Monitoring Bureau websitethe results of procurement and procurement procedures and changes during the term of the contract and the contracting authorityto enter data on contract modifications and their execution, to create a database on public procurement contracts(Procurement Contracts Register), which would compile information on each contract entered into, reflectingthe initial contract price (the amount at which the contract was concluded as a result of the procurement) and the initial(c) the term of performance, changes in the contract as a result of the changes (change in contract price and term) andthe justification for the amendment, the contract price actually paid on completion of the contract, andthe actual duration of the contract and the reasons for termination if the contract is terminated. Contractregister data to be published and visualized on the Procurement Monitoring Bureau website and open dataformat in Latvian Open Data Portal.The contract register will include the information available from the PMB websiteprocurement notices. Information on contracts for which no publication is requirednotices will not be obtained in this manner. Therefore, as far as possible, in line with what has been said in the working groupthe proposal should explore solutions and benefits and, if necessary, make proposals forproviding publicity for contracts not covered by the law as their contract price does not reachthresholds for the application of the law. Initially, which contracts are covered and from whomamounts should be eligible.When creating such a database, it is essential to protect the restricted information contained in itpublic procurement, providing for exceptions to the general procedure for such public procurementis not included in the database. 
2. Digital procurement risk assessment toolDigital procurement risk assessment tool published by the Procurement Monitoring Bureauinformation from your procurement announcements will select information such as a discontinued purchase at one gothe number of lots, the number of amendments made to the procurement documentation, and the number of purchases made by only onesupplier, the frequency with which non - competitive procedures have been used, orthe same supplier is regularly won by the same supplier, etc. etc. Digital Procurement Riskthe evaluation tool will also collect information on the number of procurement notices published by the contracting authority,which are linked to one of the characteristics of the procurement risk (the so - called red risk flags)red flags ). Once a certain level of risk has been reached, procurement authorities will be able toto establish that the procurements carried out by the contracting authority require special attention.
3. Monitoring of public procurement through the Integrity PactAnalyze the possibilities of adapting the Integrity Pact to Latvia's conditions and promoting public participationprocurement, including procurement of European Union fund projects, would be randomly selectedan appropriate Integrity Pact - an independent public benefit organization procurespublic oversight from the moment the procurement documentation is drafted until the procurement contract is completefor execution. As a result, greater transparency in the conduct of public procurement as well as correct procurement is expecteddeveloping documentation, ensuring a level playing field and complying with the lawperformance of the contract resulting from the procurement.When analyzing the possibilities of adapting the Integrity Pact to Latvia's conditions, an evaluation is made of which procurementthresholds and what kind of procurement the Integrity Pact could cover.The Commitment provides for information activities in municipalities on the Integrity Pact and its implementationopportunities and methods for non-governmental organizations with experience with the Integrity Pactimplementing seminars for municipal staff involved in public procurementand monitoring, as well as members of the public, active citizens, journalists, etc.interested. The citizens of the local government would gain knowledge on how to carry out their municipal activitiespublic procurement monitoring, as well as information on your rights to exercise such monitoring.This would facilitate procurement monitoring as well as public participation.The Integrity Pact is a form of public oversight of public procurement. That's itshall take the form of an agreement between the procuring entity, the public body and, ifif necessary, other parties such as bidders and winners.The Pact of Integrity is not a task for public authorities to monitor public procurement -delegation. The oversight functions of the Procurement Monitoring Bureau to oversee this procurementare not delegated and remain unchanged.
4. Research and promote public law contracts (delegation agreements, partnership agreementsand other contracts)The Commitment measure seeks to investigate the availability of information on public law during the reporting periodcontracts, and to develop and make specific recommendations for the transparency of information. How will the commitment help to address the issues identified?The contract register will be developed as a convenient tool for publishing, monitoring and monitoring contract performance informationcost analysis, for example, by providing information on which sectors, departments or agencies;In regions, contract prices tend to increase over the course of the contract, which suppliers usually dodoes not execute contracts for the prices offered in the procurement. Whereas the register of contracts is also intended to include:links to procurement documents and published procurement contract, it will also allow you to analyze how the procurementthe conditions imposed affect the cost and whether there is no post-contract termschange in favor of the contractor. The introduction of a register of contracts will require amendmentspublic procurement legislation, as well as providing easy entry of informationa contract register, which could then be published in an open data format and visualized in a digital formatProcurement Risk Assessment Tool for analysis. Based on the risk assessment, institutions such as PMB, CFLA, State Audit Office and Competitionthe Board will be able to carry out an in - depth assessment of the purchases made by the relevant contracting authorities, analyzing withrelevant procurement information from the respective customer, which will be provided in one place digitalprocurement risk assessment tool. Keeping in mind that the digital procurement risk assessment tool will be freeavailable on the Procurement Monitoring Bureau's website, anyone can analyze the information it collectsa representative of the company, providing convenient and fast information on the customer in question on an annual basispurchases made. The information will be available in a user-friendly way. Yesif necessary, the data will be downloadable in spreadsheet format.In circumstances where the company is actively involved in the monitoring of public procurement and the state or local governmentThe Authority shall provide supervisors with open access to information, the public shall be made aware ofthe usefulness and fairness of public procurement and whether public funds have been dealt witheffective. Citizens can be assured that public procurement is legal, so it isincreased confidence in public administration, in turn, in finding violations of public office or allegedcandidates, it is possible to report immediately to the competent authorities and to suspend or prevent themwaste of public funds.Delegation and participation agreements and other contracts also provide for public fundingperforming delegated administrative tasks and carrying out other activities. The commitment would resultIdentify the public's access to information on:the contracts referred to, the tasks entrusted to individuals and the funding granted; andrecommendations on the necessary measures to ensure transparency, including:the need for legislative changes.

Why is this commitment consistent with OGP values?The commitment shall comply with the following OGP values:
• publicity , as the Register of Contracts will provide the public with information on the contract of interest(Amendments, Execution) freely available on the Procurement Monitoring Bureau website and analyzedin the form of open data. A digital procurement risk assessment tool will provide the public with the opportunityview information about the interested purchaser in a visually friendly way, all in one placein one tool, plus downloading of selected information. Integrity Pactuse will promote openness in public procurement by making it directly accessible to the publicmonitoring the entire procurement procedure. Possible problems withTransparency of Delegation and Collaboration Agreements and Proposals for Informationimproving accessibility;
• Participation , as the contract register and digital procurement risk assessment tool will help the stateaccess to tax data for institutions, private companies and the general publicpayers' money and be better informed about the actual public procurementresults. Access to information will enable the public to become involved in procurement monitoring andto hold the management of a municipality or institution responsible for unsatisfactory procurementorganizational practices and concrete actions to improve the situation. Openness and direct public involvement in the monitoring of public procurement are expected to contributepublic officials' responsibility for the correct and lawful implementation of public procurement and public fundsusage.

LV0042,Latvia,4,3,LVA,Europe,National,1,2019,2021,2,NA,Transparency of interest representation in lobbying,Transparency in Lobbying,"What are the major national and societal challenges that this commitment will address?
The legal framework for openness in lobbying has been working in Latvia for about 10 years, but without significant practical results. So far, work has gone in two directions:
• incorporate lobbying regulations into a single law, or
• incorporate lobbying regulations into several pieces of legislation.
Concerning the first version of the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (hereinafter - KNAB) In 2007, a working group drafted the Bill on Transparency of Lobbying. However, 2014On February 17, the draft law was considered and rejected at the meeting of the Cabinet Committee, which was asked to draft itproposals for incorporating the lobbying framework into existing legislation.Work has begun to incorporate the regulation of lobbying into:
• Rules of Procedure for the Saeima (regulation of communications between the members of the Saeima and lobbyists)and third parties that influence the legislative process; to provide for liability of the Saeimathe Code of Conduct for Members),
• Public Administration Structure Law (include definition of lobbying),
• Law on Prevention of Conflict of Interest in Activities of Public Officials (lobbyingrestrictions),
• Cabinet of Ministers Instruction ""Procedure for the Initial Impact Assessment of a Legislative Draft"" (lobbyingindication of activities in the annotated act),
• Regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers “Procedures for Public Participation in the Development Planning Process” and “Procedures,where the authorities place information on the Internet ""(registration of lobbyists andpublishing).However, at both the administrative and political levels, the understanding was not uniform and the amendments did not winsupport. Amendments to the Saeima Rules of Procedure are currently in progress.

June 9, 2017 - Improvement of the Legal Environment created by President Raimonds VējonisAt the commission conference ""The need for lobbying regulation in Latvia"" it was recognized that regulation isif necessary, lobbying must be open and it is important to facilitate the decision-making processtransparency. Various models of regulation, lobbyists' registers were discussed at the conferenceand the experience of other countries and international organizations. 

There is a lot of bias in society today about lobbying. It is considered that decision-making- is not sufficiently transparent and that decisions are often made in the personal interest of one another; andnot justified or not in the public interest. However, the interests are legitimate and they must beunderstandable and open. It's important to take steps to make your interests clearer (member,owner, intermediary) person representing.In October 2019, the Saeima Defense, Internal Affairs and Anti-Corruption Commission established a working groupthe drafting of a Transparency Bill on Lobbying. Developed by the Saeima Analytical Service in 2019a study on lobbying. The Task Force started drafting a Transparency Bill in 2020.The Saeima working group intends to develop a comprehensive framework to promote interestsopenness of representation in various branches of state power.

What is the commitment?
The commitment is to promote openness of interests and lobbying in the following areas:
• Improvement of the regulation of interest representation (lobbying openness),
• information measures, including in the general public, to promote transparency of interests represented; andawareness of its benefits,
• Initiative to introduce greater openness regarding meetings of certain officials (opencalendars),
• Understanding the openness of lobbying within institutions (at the level of employees and managers).

How will the commitment help to address the issues identified?
The Law on Interest Representation (Lobbying Openness) would address the ongoing unified lobbying opennessthe lack of a legal framework. Openness about the interests that have been created will be promotedcertain decisions (the interests of which groups were heard). It would also improve the participatory process as it would bemore precise and systematic identification of not only participants / coordinators but also lobbyists, withwho have had meetings, how and what specific interests the person / organization has represented.

Why is this commitment consistent with OGP values?
The commitment shall comply with the following OGP values:
• openness through greater access to information and clarity about the interests represented;
• accountability by requiring the public to be informed of the interests affected by the decisions. Alsoindividuals and organizations will have to indicate what interests they represent;
• Participation by promoting equal access to the decision-making process.

Lead implementing agency	Information Society Development Committee under the Ministry of the Economy and Innovation
Commitment description 
Current situation (status quo) and the public problem that the commitment will address 	Public sector institutions have accumulated a wealth of valuable information that is not readily and freely available for re-use in business development, promotion of economic growth, increasing public sector transparency, addressing social issues, promoting social and civic engagement.
Problem solution/Commitment	The problem will be solved by developing methodological tools and technological possibilities for public sector institutions to open up the data they manage: 
•	Methodological legal framework has been created to provide for preconditions for Lithuanian public sector institutions to form open data sets and their metadata and to publish them on the Lithuanian Open Data Portal.
•	An information technology infrastructure has been developed to make public sector data and metadata public and to provide information to domestic users (businesses, public organisations and citizens) and it has been integrated into the European Open Data Infrastructure.
•	The organisational structure for the planning, financing and implementation of open data activities has been implemented.
Main objective	Create Lithuania’s open data portal
How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? 	•	The creation of Lithuania’s open data portal will provide business representatives, non-governmental organisations and active citizens with access to information resources accumulated and opened up by the institutions, while public sector institutions will enjoy the benefit of greater accessibility and transparency.
•	Opening public sector data will enable active members of the public to make proposals and influence decision-making, while at the same time developing citizens’ trust in government institutions and their civic engagement.
•	Adopted and implemented decisions on the organisational structure of open data will create the prerequisite for the smooth opening of public sector data and will enable the public to assess the effectiveness of public sector decisions and the related accountability.

Strengthen civic society through the development of non-governmental organisations (‘NGO’) database and NGO fund

Lead implementing agency	Ministry of Social Security and Labour of the Republic of Lithuania
Commitment description 
Status quo or problem addressed by the commitment	Since 2004, data on legal entities regarded as NGOs have been at the disposal of the state enterprise (SE) Centre of Registers. The expansion of the scope of the data collected and, consequently, the structuration of the data may help create a database to provide public authorities and the public at large with a simple form of information on whether the relevant legal entity is an NGO.
The problem to be solved is that part of the financial resources allocated by the state to strengthen civil society does not reach the intended recipient, as legal entities are not clearly classified (i.e. which are to be regarded as NGOs and which are not), part of the resources intended for strengthening of civil society eventually end up in the hands of public authorities, business associations and so on. This poses challenges for the sustainable development of the civil society sector.

For many consecutive years, NGO projects have been funded from the state budget. However, even though a lot of financial resources have been invested in different projects in different fields, the breakthrough in strengthening NGOs and the quality of their projects has failed to materialise. NGOs are still weakly involved in decision-making processes, fail to immediately and appropriately respond to emerging opportunities regarding decision-making at regional or national level. The main problem to be solved is the weak capacity of NGOs to engage and participate in the decision-making process professionally.
Problem solution/Commitment	The problem will be addressed by legally providing that not only public bodies but also legal entities that have the legal form of a charity, support fund and association shall furnish information about their shareholders (members) to the system of the participants of legal entities. Once these data have been properly processed, it will be possible to create a tool that will facilitate easier recognition of NGOs.

The problem will be addressed with the help of financial means – through an NGO fund, which will operate as a programme administered by the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, intended to strengthen NGO capacity to participate in public policy and decision-making processes.
Main objective	Creation of NGO data base and NGO fund
How will the commitment contribute to solve the problem? 	Once an NGO database has been established, public authorities and the public will be able to easily and clearly determine whether the relevant legal entity is to be regarded as an NGO and to take this into account when taking a decision regarding the funding of the activities, projects, etc. of such a legal entity.

There are currently no sustainable mechanisms in place to help strengthen the capacity of NGOs to participate in decision-making processes. The creation of an NGO fund will provide a mechanism that will enable strengthening of such capacities; as a sustainable entity, the NGO fund will carry out the regular monitoring (as to the developments regarding the public participation in public policy and decision-making processes) and, in the light of the results, will accordingly improve the fund’s strategy and activities.

7.	Launching NGO fund into operation	The activities of the NGO fund identified, staff recruited and the fund launched into operation	01/08/2019	01/10/2019
How is the commitment relevant to the values of transparency, accountability and civic participation?	The commitment will open up data on NGOs operating in Lithuania, improve the quality of open data and information, and increase the accessibility of availability of information about NGOs to the public and institutions.

The commitment will increase civil society’s access to public funding.

The commitment will strengthen the capacity of NGOs to participate in decision-making processes (linked to the value of civic engagement. 
Additional information 	The provisions related to the premises for the establishment of the NGO database are included in the amendments to the draft law amending the Law on Development of Non-governmental Organisations and other related documents).

A concept of the NGO database has been worked out too. There is an ongoing discussions with the Centre of Registers, Ministry of Justice. For the part of the commitment related to the creation of the NGO database, the estimated budget is EUR 3 million.

For the part of the commitment related to the creation of the NGO fund, negotiations are held with the Ministry of Finance as regards funding sources. Provisions regarding the NGO fund are included in the draft law amending the Law on Development of NGO.

The commitment is part of the Plan for the implementation of the Programme of the 17th Government.

Lead implementing agency	Ministry of Justice
Commitment description 
Status quo or problem addressed by the commitment 	Recently there have been many inconsistencies in the legislative process, often with the same legislation being repeatedly amended failing to take on board the consequences caused by previous amendments. Furthermore, the national audit report by the National Audit Office of 16 March 2018 has found that the existing instrument - the monitoring of the legal regulation - is applied in a fragmented manner, the monitoring is low quality, and it is therefore necessary to move to a systematic approach as to the impact assessment of the legislation. Such a need was identified in OECD report of 29 July 2015.
Problem solution/Commitment	Mainstreaming ex post evaluation in legislative process.
Main objective	The aim is to create an ex post evaluation model, which will serve as the basis for specific legislative proposals.
How will the commitment contribute to solve the problem? 	The implementation of the provisions proposed in the draft law should result in a positive impact on the transparency of the legislative process and the quality of the decisions taken - the evidence gathered during the impact assessment of the final legal regulation would be used to decide on the need to change the existing legal regulation. Besides, a closer public participation in the evaluation process is expected to improve the quality of legislation and better reflect the interests of the population concerned.

How is the commitment relevant to the values of transparency, accountability and civic participation?	The commitment is relevant to the improvement of the existing legislative process, as it provides for the shift from fragmented evaluation of legal regulation to systemic evaluation of its problematic areas. There are also wide opportunities to engage the public in this process.

MW0001,Malawi,1,1,MWI,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2016,2018,2,NA,Freedom of Information,Freedom of Information,"Section 37 of the Malawi Constitution guarantees the right to information. However, there is no enabling legislation to regulate and operationalize access to information. Government adopted a policy on access to information. The Access to Information I Bill has been approved by Cabinet, its been gazetted and its awaiting enactment by the Malawi Parliament. 

Main objective: To improve the flow of information from the government to citizens and ensure that citizens access the information held by government. 

Brief description: The enactment   of the access to information law underpins the need to realize the constitutional principles on right to information. Easy access to information increases transparency, which in turn, promotes accountability by enabling citizens to hold duty bearers to account for their actions. 

Challenges: Limited access to relevant information by citizens of Government actions undermines achievement of development outcomes, weakens democracy and frustrates enjoyment of all rights. Limited public access to information on Government actions perpetuates a culture of secrecy, which undermines public confidence in public institutions and its officials.

Intended results: Increasing citizen access to information improves the quality of development and governance outcomes. Information enables citizens to know what is happening. Such knowledge increases citizen’s ability to hold duty bearers to account for their commitments and responsibilities as well as demand for enforcement of sanctions whenever accountability deficit occurs. Availability of information on human rights and breaches of these rights helps citizens to secure the protection of their rights. Access to information is also fundamental in delivering deeper, inclusive and more participatory forms of governance. By providing information on development and service delivery and obtaining feedback on matters that affect them, citizens are able to make more informed choices and decisions as well as respond better to opportunities.

Enhanced Open Contracting to improve transparency and reduce opportunities for procurement malfeasance through open tendering; Institutionalizing (legislation/regulation) and operationalizing (collecting, publishing, verifying and using) beneficial ownership transparency for all legal entities in Malawi engaged in public procurement.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? 

The commitment will address the following governance problems: 
1. Grand corruption by public servants including malfeasance such as awarding contracts to business entities whose beneficial owners are themselves, family or associates; 
2. Collusion and fraud in public procurement involving state (Public servants and governing politicians) and business actors to rig the public procurement system to their mutual benefits; 
3. Rigging of the public procurement system by removing any meaningful competition among bidders especially when procurement methods other than single sourcing are used which enable different business entities belonging to the same shareholders to compete against each other; 
4. Procurement monopolies and cronyism whereby certain families dominate public procurement through their business outfits and effectively disproportionately feed off the state and effectively ‘capture the state’  
5. Collusion involving price fixing which distorts the operation of the market to determine the correct value of goods and services being procured and defeats the principle of value for money. 
6. Verification of compliance with the MSME Public Procurement Order especially to check big companies participating in public procurement under the MSME order through fronting MSMEs. 

2. What are the causes of the problem? 

1. Non-disclosure of beneficial ownership of business entities: The law in its current format requires businesses to declare and register directors of business entities as legal owners of the entities. Beneficial owners are left out and recent experiences show clearly that addressing or avoiding the problems of procurement monopolies and the specter of state capture, the registration of business entities with the Registrar General as well as the registration with the Public procurement ad Disposal of assets Authority and bid documents must require disclosure of beneficial owners of the business entities participating in the public procurement system. 
2. Frequent or normalized use of exclusionary procurement methods especially restricted tender and single source which provide opportunities for various procurement malfeasance and in recent times have proved to be the most effective ways through which procurement monopolies have been created and have also catalyzed the phenomenon of state capture by business elements.

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? 

1. Introduced vetting of public procurements of high value by the Anti- Corruption Bureau (ACB) but the vetting process has institutional and operational weaknesses so much that it does not detect all or some procurement malfeasances; 
2. In 2012, Government introduced downstream vetting of contracts by the Government Contracts Units (GCU) in OPC but it is sometimes by-passed by MDAs and is accused of delaying procurements; 
3. PPDA Regulations to address opacity in the public procurement chain including providing guidance on dealing with conflict of interests and other malfeasance but compliance and enforcement of the regulations in a context where the PPDA is centralized but public procurement is decentralized is problematic; 
4. Legal requirement for procuring entities to seek authorization (‘No objection’) from the PPDA to use exclusionary methods of procurement such as single sourcing. However, compliance, enforcement and quality of due diligence have been problematic as evidenced by the continued occurrence of procurements with problematic issues. 
5. The PPDA has stepped up efforts to curb corruption by partnering Deloitte’s Tip Offs Anonymous, an ethics hotline where informants can report malpractices. Deloitte’s Tip Offs Anonymous has been offering the service for over 13 years and its core competency is the ability to keep informants’ identity anonymous. Deloitte submits the tip-offs with a report to concerned institutions to investigate but does not monitor the conclusion of the cases. Through the partnership, PPDA receives and considers reports on flouting procurement procedures, conflict of interest, disclosure of sensitive and privileged information, corruption, kickbacks and collusion, contract and procurement fraud and fast-tracking of registration processes and overriding policies, among others. 
6. PPDA is in the process of establishing an E- Procurement System that will revolutionize procurement. This five-year project is being financed by the World Bank under the Digital Malawi Project. 

2. What solution are you proposing? 

1. Malawi’s Companies Act (and associated corporate affairs regulations) and public procurement laws are strengthened by including provisions to mandate the collection and open publication of beneficial ownership information of all companies. This, coupled with publishing the list of beneficial owners of companies that engage in public procurement will address the problem of procurement monopolies that have arisen through companies with a shared beneficial owner competing for contracts with each other. Likewise, the bids must contain the names of the beneficial owners which will appear in bid evaluation reports, Notices of Intention to Award and the Contract Award Notices published in widely read newspapers and the PPDA website .This will allow the citizens, civil society organisations and other non-state actors to ventilate the decisions made by the public officers especially when certain rules or principles like competition or value for money are violated. 
2. Adoption of and instilling principles of Open Contracting in the public procurement process to increase transparency. This will minimize or completely stop the abuse of exclusionary procurement methods i.e. Single source and restricted tender. 
3. Adopt and transition to centralized e-procurement to be managed by the PPDA to foster transparency and accountability hence promoting integrity in public procurement. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? 

The implementation of this commitment is expected to enhance efficiency, transparency, accountability and competitiveness in public procurement. The following output level results will be achieved: 
a. Strengthened legal framework that require registration and disclosure of beneficial owners of companies. 
b. List of beneficial owners published online and other media outlets and accessible to the public for accountability and transparency. 
c. Paradigm shift to more open and competitive electronic public procurement process. 
d. Increased citizen monitoring of public procurement through civil society organisations who will now be able to monitor cost-effectiveness in public spending and detect red flags for corruption, and generally support accountability in public spending. 
e. Increased corruption prevention in public procurement through vetting of bids and beneficial ownership by the ACB. 
f. Increased ethical conduct of officers in the public procurement profession as the mechanism will prevent public money ending up in private pockets of public officials; will detect and prevent unlawful arrangements among companies in public procurements and will prevent illusionary competition in tender procedures among companies with same beneficial ownership. 

Commitment Analysis

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? How will it help improve citizens’ access to information and data? How will it make the government more transparent? The list of beneficial ownership will be proactively shared to the public through the PPDA website and other channels and will be available upon request under the Access to Information Act. The publication of the list of beneficial ownership coupled with increased open tendering and contracting will promote transparency which is necessary for accountability in public procurement. 

2. How will commitment help foster accountability? How will it help public agencies become more accountable to the public? How will it facilitate citizens’ ability to learn how the implementation is progressing? How will it support transparent monitoring and evaluation systems? The procuring entities will be more accountable in the utilization of public funds because there will be more scrutiny from the public including civil society organisations due to easily accessed information on public procurements. The citizens will be sensitized on how to access the list of beneficial ownership from the PPDA and other contractual documents using the PPDA Act and the Access to Information Act. Access to information on huge public procurements will foster monitoring of public procurements by oversight bodies like the Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Auditor general, Parliamentary Oversight Committees, and civil society organisations. 

3. How will commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? How will it proactively engage citizens and citizen groups? The commitment is envisaged to catalyze the participation of civil society in the process of developing the relevant amendments to the law. Once the amendment Bill will be published by the Ministry of Justice or Clerk of Parliament, it will trigger Civil society organisations and private sector associations including the MCCI to consider the Bill and develop their inputs and positions on the Bill and engage authorities such as the Ministry of Justice or the Legal Affairs Committee of Parliament on appropriate amendments to the Bill. The legislative process of the Malawi Parliament has a few points that invite public inputs into proposed legislation that is under consideration by Parliament. In particular, the Legal Affairs Committee of Parliament is expected, as per the Standing Orders of Parliament, to call for inputs into the Bill from the public and to hold a public hearing on the Bill as part of Parliament’s consultative process . Furthermore, civil society organizations can prepare their own bill and present to Parliament for consideration as a private bill or may present a petition to Parliament regarding the Bill The private sector is particularly targeted by the reform in this commitment. Upon publication of the first version of the Bill, Peak business associations at macro and sectoral levels, will be specifically asked to prepare and submit their views and suggestions on the Bill either before it is introduced in Parliament or during its consideration by Parliament. The disclosure of the list of beneficial ownership and the competitive open tendering processes and contracts will increasingly open public procurement thus stimulate public interest and activism against malpractices in the procurement cycle from advertising of tenders, evaluation of the bid documents, offering and signing of contracts and implementation, monitoring and evaluation of performance of the contractors.

The commitment will create the much-sought opportunity for Parliamentarians to effectively address the problem of opaque public debt by enabling transparent meaningful scrutiny of loan Authorization Bills through committee public hearings. This is important because additional public debt should only be agreed with clear, transparent and measurable policy objectives that align with Malawi’s Vision 2063.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? The commitment seeks to address the problem of opaque public debt i.e. non-transparent lending and borrowing that is done in such ways that the funds are not track-able and neither governments nor lenders can be held accountable for their financial decisions. International loans, authorized by Parliament have so far been opaque debt in the sense that Loan authorization Bills have always been treated as emergencies. The bills appear without adequate notice to MPs, pertinent details of the loans are not disclosed, the Budget and Finance committee is by-passed, debt sustainability is hardly debated, and the bills are enacted without scrutiny. Opaque debt has been the norm for decades and has affected Malawians in many ways including fueling corruption, shrinking future fiscal space and undermining the integrity of Parliament. However, there are serious public concerns with sub-optimal utilization of the loans and the erosion of fiscal space through debt servicing and repayments. 

2. What are the causes of the problem? The root cause of the phenomenon of opaque debt, especially with respect to foreign loans, are the attitudes of the political executive which hold that loans are procured for developmental projects and that no parliamentarian in their sane mind would reject a loan authorization bill. Consequently, the parliamentary procedure is truncated and mostly rubber-stamps loan contracting proposals from the executive. This practice has come to be known as ‘the tradition’ and is used to quickly curtail debate on money bills which forestalls the necessary amount of transparency on Government’s international borrowing. On the other side, despite the availability of an enabling legal and legislative framework for Parliament’s scrutiny, Parliament has lacked the stamina to operationalize its mandate on scrutiny of loan bills and contribute to sustainable public debt management. The Executive dominates and subdues the National Assembly. The Bills are circulated without adequate information to the MPs especially on the conditions of the loan and the project to be implemented. There is asymmetric information between the loan negotiators (Ministry of Finance) and loan authorizers (Parliamentarians) as the latter only have the bill at their disposal with scanty information in the memorandum section to the Bill and in about six standard clauses that make the money bill. 

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? 

a. Since 2020, the Speaker of Parliament has required that all Bills, including loan authorization bills, should adhere to the 28 day rule on notice and that the standing order that allows to waive this rule should be used only with the agreement of leaders of other political parties in Parliament. The Speaker has also insisted on at least 7 day notice after publication of the money bill before it is introduced in the National Assembly. However, this has not been sufficiently effective. At best loan bills have been published for two days before being introduced in the Assembly and they are debated and passed in the shortest possible time; 
b. Parliamentarians have raised the need for the Minister of Finance to share helpful information about the loans being sought but this too has not been accomplished except for the Minister to say a few things about the loan when introducing the Loan Authorization bill for debate and approval of Parliament. 

2. What solution are you proposing? The proposed solution of mandatory referral of money bills to the Budget and Finance means that once a money (loan authorization) bill is published, the bill, like any others will stand referred to the Budget and Finance Committee. The Committee will scrutinize the loan in question and prepare a report for the National Assembly. The Committee will be furnished with supplementary information, for example, justification of proposed bills (alignment with policy goals), status of existing loans, information about the lender Committee scrutiny entails that the committee will deploy the powers given to it under the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA)19 and Standing Orders to call exercise oversight on government borrowing. Section 22(1) of the PFM provides as follows: 

22.-(1) For purposes of exercising any responsibility under this Act, the Budget Committee --- a) May inquire into any Government financial matter. b) Shall have full access to Government records relating to revenue, expenditure and any other public resources which are relevant to an inquiry. c) May, by notice in writing, require any person having possession or control of any Government records relating to revenue, expenditure and other public resources, to deliver to the committee all or any record specified in the notice. In the absence of a mandatory referral of the money bills to the Budget and Finance Committee, the tradition of by-passing the committee on loan authorization bills will continue and the powers of oversight given to the committee will lie unused. The work of the committee is open to the public and maybe broadcast live. This process will increase transparency in government borrowing, generate public insights on debt management and sustainability and ascertain the absolute necessity for contracting any given loan. It will also publicize the loan and the corresponding project so that civil society actors and beneficiary communities can engage in social accountability initiatives to ensure optimal utilization of the resources borrowed through the loans in question.

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? The implementation of this commitment will help to achieve the following results: i. Removing opacity and enhancing transparency of government borrowing. ii. Members of Parliament will develop skills for assessing debt sustainability and viability of loans. iii. Ministry of Finance will become more accountable for its decisions to contract sovereign debt through loan authorization bills. iv. Over time, it will reduce the propensity of the political executive to borrow money as they will have to put up a robust case before the Budget Committee of Parliament.

Commitment Analysis

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? How will it help improve citizens’ access to information and data? How will it make the government more transparent to citizens? Committee proceedings will be open to the public and broadcast live. Government Officials will appear before the committee to explain things and answer questions under oath. 

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? How will it help public agencies become more accountable to the public? How will it facilitate citizens’ ability to learn how the implementation is progressing? How will it support transparent monitoring and evaluation systems? Public officers will account for their decision to borrow money

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? How will it proactively engage citizens and citizen groups? During committee hearings, citizens and groups of people and CSOs with competence on the subject will be able to engage the committee and make submissions that will influence recommendations of the committee for or against the loan in question. For approved loans, citizens will have accessed enough information about development projects being financed so they can monitor effectively and hold project delivers accountable.

MW0010,Malawi,2,5,MWI,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2023,2025,2,Natural Resources,Enhanced transparency in natural resource governance,Transparency in Natural Resource Governance,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

The commitment will increase transparency on all aspects of the natural resource chain. This includes the status of existing known resources, contracting and licensing processes and agreements, production, exports, employment, revenue and expenditure, and social and environmental governance. It builds on but modifies and extends the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) in that the EIT largely focuses only on one component of the resource chain, namely, revenues.

Problem Definition 

3. What problem does the commitment aim to address? The commitment will address two related problems. Firstly, the opacity that characterizes the natural resource chain in Malawi. In particular, the contracting process is not transparent and there is a widespread perception that mining and oil and gas contracts, in particular, are not sufficiently negotiated to the long term economic benefit of the country and its citizens. Beneficial ownership transparency is also weak in the licencing process, which increases the risk of corruption. While there is some delayed transparency on tax and non-tax revenue derived from some companies in the extractive industries, there is no information on expenditure from mining-related revenue as the revenue comingles with revenue from other sources. Further, responsibilities for environmental rehabilitation/regeneration are either not clearly delineated or are not enforced and affected communities do not have information. Secondly, citizen engagement in natural resource governance is minimal because of the unavailability of information that would be the basis for effective engagement and the pervasiveness of misinformation. Furthermore, there is the lack of clarity of how citizens can take action to improve the situation – both mining affected communities as well as civic actors. 

4. What are the causes of the problem? Insufficient transparency across the mineral resource chain is partly attributed to a lingering culture of secrecy in the public sector as well as in mining corporations. For example, between 2007 when the Kayerekera Mining Agreement was signed and 2016 when the contract was disclosed, Government officials claimed that the contract could not be made public, not even to Parliament, because of a confidentiality clause when the contract did not have such a clause. Furthermore, despite having the mandate and power to exercise oversight in ways that would enhance transparency over the mineral resource chain, the parliamentary committee on natural resources and climate change has been slow, if at all, on exercising its mandate to benefit transparency in the mining sector, particularly after a disclosure regime kicked in. One reason for this is that Parliamentarians are not well versed with mining discourse and practice to enable them to engage in meaningful oversight to benefit transparency and accountability.

Commitment Description 

4. What has been done so far to solve the problem? 

Disclosure of all mining development agreements and licenses. Malawi is required to disclose any contracts and licenses that are granted, entered into or amended that provide the terms attached to the exploitation of oil, gas and minerals. However, the model of disclosure (uploading to a resource contract repository) does not sufficiently disseminate to the majority of Malawians and relevant Malawian authorities such as Parliament. It also only includes mining development agreements and not all licenses issues. Even though licenses are typically standard and are not negotiated, these should all be disclosed to provide information on licence holders, date of issuance, minerals, tenement, and other information that is of particular interest to mining-affected communities. Thus opacity still prevails, much more so because the language of the contracts is not easily accessible to people without mining acumen. Furthermore, contract disclosures only cover the first part of the resource chain and are made public after execution of the contracts with minimal opportunities to influence the fiscal regime embedded in them. The second part of the resource chain is disclosed, again post facto, through the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) through which Government agencies declare their receipts of payments from mining companies and the companies publish what they pay to government agencies. However, there is still no transparency on how and for what resources from mining are expended. Through the Malawi EITI (MWEIT), Malawi has also committed to the disclosure of beneficial owners; disclosures in the report are voluntary, they are not verified and they do not always include the names of the real owners. In the most recent report published in 2019, only legal ownership was reported. Further, only a small proportion of companies are involved in the reporting. The Mines and Minerals Act (2019) also requires applicants for specific licences to disclose the beneficial owners of the applicant entity (with a 5% threshold). In the absence of a central beneficial ownership register, the beneficial owners for all companies with licences in Malawi’s natural resources sector should be disclosed to the public by the Ministry of Mines and not only in the annual MWEITI report, which is not accessible to all people. Malawi recently achieved a moderate overall score in implementing the EITI Transparency Standard. Malawi continued using EITI implementation to further extractive industry accountability, support the country’s anti-corruption efforts, strengthen transparency of the mining, petroleum, transportation and forestry sectors, license and contract allocations, distribution of revenues as well as social and environmental expenditures. Identified areas for further improvements on disclosing data on extractive licensing activities, including transfers and non-trivial deviations from statutory procedures, transparency in the full texts of licenses and contracts, and beneficial ownership disclosure. 

5. What solution are you proposing? 

1. Creation of a Regulatory framework for the sector to ensure that disclosure of natural resource contracts and beneficial owners should entail responsible duty bearers explaining each contract to the parliamentary committee on Natural Resources and Climate change as a proxy of the people, in live broadcast public hearings to equip the MPs and interested citizens and civil society organisations to exercise meaningful oversight, identify loose ends and loopholes that can be tightened to ensure responsible natural resource governance; 
2. The creation of a sovereign fund with clear and transparent rules of deposits and withdrawals to ensure that proceeds from mineral wealth are invested in public goods that connect the present to the future. 
3. For future natural resource contracts, require the draft contracts to be scrutinized by the parliamentary committee on natural resources during which process the Ministry of Finance would be required present a financial model of each proposed fiscal regime especially if it deviates from the Taxation Amendment Act (mining fiscal regime), 2016, to understand and ensure optimization of government revenues from each mining project. 

6. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? 

The main result to be achieved from this commitment is transparency across the entire natural resource chain which will catalyze active and critical citizenship. The benefits of transparency across the resource chain include better ability to collect payments due to the government; more efficient negotiation and management of minerals extraction agreements; stronger protections against financial crime such as corruption, money laundering, and tax evasion; and greater access to international markets where expectations for responsibly sourced mineral and accountable governance of mineral resources are increasingly becoming the norm. Transparency will optimize the revenue collected from minerals and generate greater value for money expenditures that invest in public goods for the long-term economic development of the country.

Commitment Analysis

5. How will the commitment promote transparency? How will it help improve citizens’ access to information and data? How will it make the government more transparent to citizens? Parliamentary committee proceedings will enable many people understand what’s going on with each mining agreement and will also enable MPs and other civil society actors to carry out effective oversight of mineral resource governance 

6. How will the commitment help foster accountability? How will it help public agencies become more accountable to the public? How will it facilitate citizens’ ability to learn how the implementation is progressing? How will it support transparent monitoring and evaluation systems? Disclosure of information along the extractive sector value chain (including, for example mining contracts, beneficial owners and revenue figures) will enhance accountability for payments and receipts from mining activities and also for utilization of the proceeds from mining 

7. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? How will it proactively engage citizens and citizen groups? The commitment will make information and insight available to citizens and groups and enable them to engage in policy advocacy on any grey areas in the resource chain for any mineral and any mining contract.

Journalists are worried about government actions to directly control the media. Currently, media outlets can are meeting the domestic demand for its 3 million people. Many large companies and politicians now own the media or have a “cooperation agreement” with the media that restricts the media from publicly releasing any negative information about that person or company.

MN0048,Mongolia,4,1,MNG,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2021,2023,2,NA,Strengthening extractive industry transparency,Strengthening Extractive Industry Transparency,"Statement of public problem Mongolia’s extractive industry is a core economy sector making up alone 20-30% of fiscal revenues.1 The country’s long-term development strategy Vision 2050 defines the mining sector to hold the position for the coming 30 years.2 The important role of the sector makes promoting good governance through improved transparency and public participation, and strengthened government and private sector accountability priority issues for the industry. Mongolia scored 70 points out of 100 for the Natural Resources Governance Index in 2021 with recommendations on strengthening transparency. It is a prime necessity that the Ministry of Mining and Heavy Industry (MMHI) and the Mineral Resources and Petroleum Authority (MRPA) uphold open data norms by expanding the use of digital information and, in particular, providing public access to a better disaggregated information on licensing, industry production and sales in digital formats allowing data processing.3 Although the MRPA places the license holder information on its website, the practice does not meet the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) disclosure requirements for the completeness of information and machine-readable digital formatting. Furthermore, the production and sales information should be more detailed than the project-level data currently furnished, and discrepancies in the Customs Office, MRPA and National Statistical Office (NSO) data need to be eliminated. Although Mongolia has been implementing the EITI since 2006, the failure to put in place a more effective legal framework is resulting in challenges such as weak government monitoring and mainstreaming of open data processes, and lapses in transparent contract management and public disclosure of beneficial ownership information. Hence, the pressing needs are as follows: • to assure transparency and public monitoring for each and every stage of natural resources management starting from exploration to production and to revenue allocation; • to prevent corruption and conflict of interest in the extractive uindustry by creating an enabling business environment for fair competition and to expand sector development by attracting investment; • to improve public information and public debate for better natural resource management policy and decision making process. 

Commitment definition Adopt a Mineral Resouces Transparency Law to lay legal grounds for establishing international transparency standards in the sector, assuring due disclosure of contract management and beneficial ownership information, strengthening the governance of wholly or partially state- owned enterprises and guaranteeing civil society participation in decision-making. 

Contribution to addressing public problem - Submission of the draft Mineral Resources Transparency Law to the Parliament for deliberations at the Autumn Session 2021. - Establishment of an integrated mineral resources information system: It will contain comprehensive information and data such as minerals and oil exploration and exploitation licenses; land and water use permits; environmental and social impact assessment reports; environmental management plans and reports; mineral resources reserves, exploration, production and sales, prices and revenues data; taxes, royalties and fees paid to state and local budgets; rehabilitated land area and environmental protection expenditures; all contracts awarded by public agencies for subterranean resource exploitation, especially procurement and sales contracts of state-owned enterprises; benefical owners information; financial transactions, transfers and budget allocations done with public agencies; the Future Heritage Fund income and expenditure, efficiency assessments and financial reports. - Project operations transparency and reporting: Each active project will be providing comprehensive and disaggregated data on the extracted, processed and marketed products; royalties and land and water use fees; affected land area, environmental rehabilitation expenditures and other relevant matter; - Roles and responsibilities of relevant public authorities and state-owned companies will be precisely defined for transparency purposes so that they establish a routine process of entering their respective information in the database in open data formats; - Safe and secure information database operation ensured with appropriate technical and technological solutions; - Setting up institutional arrangements ensuring transparency and public engagement in extractive industry policy dialogue. The definition of roles and responsibilities of civil society representatives in the EITI National Committee by the proposed mineral resources transparency law will ensure their effective participation in the extractive sector’s policy planning and implementation. 

Relevance to OGP values • Advances transparency and access to quality information • Strengthens public engagement in government authorities decision making, creates favorable environment for civil society; • Reinforces the potential for the public to influence government policy making and creates favourable conditions for civil society activism. 

Additional information ● Funding The adoption of a Mineral Resources Transparency Law requires no expense as the feasibility study and other relevant assessments including cost estimations have already been completed. ● Policy coherence The Mongolian Government Action Plan 2020-2024 states: Provision 4.1.8.”Increase information transparency of public sector operations and ensure the participation of citizens and communities Provision 3.2. ”...Develop transparent and responsible mining...”4 The draft Mineral Resources Transparency Law is listed on the agenda of the Parliament’s Autumn Session. ● Consistent with National Development Policy and Guidelines, other sectoral and/or local development programs and plans, e.g. Mongolia’s Vision 2050 Long-term Development Policy’s Provision 4.2.1 sets the goal to develop responsible mining. ● Relevance to the [UN] Sustainable Development Goals Transparency in the mineral resources industry, a core economic sector, not only supports the sector’s development but also has positive impact on other social and economic spheres, thus duly contributing to the SDGs achievement. It contributes to the objectives of poverty and inequality reduction, health and quality education services, gender equality, decent work and economic growth, innovation and infrastructure development, climate change mitigation, dryland ecosystems protection, peace and justice building, and fostering partnerships for development. ● Gender assessment and monitoring The adoption of the proposed Mineral Resources Transparency Law will bring to light the information on male and female labor force participation in mining and oil industries, and programs, projects and other initiatives on women’s participation and employment implemented under the mining community development agreements. Analysis of these records will contribute to identifyng the extractive industry’s gender impacts and formulating appropriate policy responses. 

Target definition An effective legal environment is in place to ensure optimal use of the benefits of natural resources for sustainable development and their just and fair distribution to all citizens today and in the future, and to guarantee the implementation of the people’s constitutional right to know as true owners of the natural wealth. 

Follow-up actions ● Assessment of the new law’s implementation and effects; ● Public information and communication activities to promote the law and its implementation; ● Review the mineral resources database against the open data requirements; ● Strengthen the capacity of media and civic organizations for open data use and monitoring

There is an urgent need to improve the existing legislation so that it protects the public’s ’ right to know, establishes the highest degree of transparency of government information, allows secrecy of information only for public interest purposes and prohibits an agency from discretionary classification of its information.. 2/ The pandemic is being accompanied by an ‘infodemic’, a new phenomenon of a spread of false information that aggravates the damage inflicted on people especially in terms of increasing denial of vaccination. People living in remote areas or isolated groups, and low income or low media literacy persons have been affected particularly heavily as demonstrated by the experience of recent years. On the other hand, there have been many incidents where individuals who expressed their views and criticism of government services in the social media were gven warnings, fined or detained, and media workers were denied the right to seek, receive and impart information through access restrictions and censorship. Attempts to control media coverage through undue influence and pressure up to threats by local authorities have been reported as well. Hence, it is important to upgrade communication strategies for emergency situations and to increase the availability of public information. 

Commitment definition Urgently strengthen the legal framework to end the malpractice of withholding information from the public under the guise of “secret” and to ensure the exercise of citizens’ right to know and to timely receive information in appropriate formats during pandemics and other such emergency situations. In order to ensure public access to information other than that the government and its institutions are legally bound to protect, the existing legislation shall be aligned with international legal norms, in particular, the letter and spirit of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Politicial Rights. 1/ Strengthen Mongolia’s Law on Information Transparency and Right to Information and Law on State and Official Secrets by allowing denial of access to information and its classification as state or official secret only when and where the UN Human Rights Commission’s all three tests for permissible limitations of the right to information apply simultaneously: a/ the given information is pertinent to the interests defined by law; b/ materiality of damages entailed by information disclosure is mandatorily assessed and presented as a proof of the limitation of the right to information; and c/ the said material damage(s) take precedence over the public interest of the freedom of information. Amend the Law on State and Official Secrets by anulling Article 13.2 which states that “public organizations and other legal entities shall develop their lists of pertinent sectoral and agency information subject to classification as state secret[…], obtain clearance by the intelligence agency and submit to the Government for approval”, and Article 14.1 stating “The list of information to be classified as official secret shall be compiled by the relevant authority and approved by the decisions of the Member of the Cabinet in charge of the portfolio and the Chief Executive of the organization”, and adopt a separate law on the identification and registration procedure for state and official secrets. 2/ Take action to evaluate the application and improve the implementation thereof of the Law on Legislation, Law on Public Hearing and General Administrative Law of Mongolia that directly bear on the transparency of government processes and the right of people to participation. 

Contribution to addressing public problem 1/ Improvement of Mongolia’s ranking in international independent reports on information freedom. Special care will be taken of the following aspects in the implementation of the commitment: • The draft law undergoes vigorous and broadly-based public discussion which is organized to meet the principle of meaningful participation; • The Parliament duly monitorsand reviews the implementation of the law; • Training and consultative activities build the capacity of relevant actors and stakeholders for effective implementation and monitoring; • Civil society engagement in the aforementioned activities is ensured at all stages and times; 2/ A system of multi-stakeholder partnership is fostered to promote high quality communication and information flows, and to strenghten mutual trust between citizens, the media and government. The increased availability of and access to public informaton will importantly factor in the fulfilment of the right to information of vulnerable population groups. 

Relevance to OGP values ● Transparency Better exercise of the right to information by opening up more data and information to the public, improving the quality of the existing and protecting public access to information. ● Public engagement Increased opportunities and capacites of the public to be informed of and influence government decision-making. ● Government accountability Enhanced openness and availability of information assures public accountability of government and civil servants. 

Policy coherence • Relevance to the SDGs: Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and develop effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels; its Target 16.5. (Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms); Target 16.6. (Develop effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels); Target 16.7 (ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory, and representative decision making at all levels); Target 16.10 (Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements); • In 2020, Mongolia submitted the Third National SDG Report and received recommendations from UN member-countries on the freedom of expression including the following: - protect freedom of expression by revoking Article 6.21 of the Law on Infringements - 70 (UK); Though the said legal provision has been revoked, Section 13.14 added to the Criminal Code in 2020 poses a risk to the freedoms of expression and information if applied wrongfully. • Parliament-approved policy documents contain provisions on the right to information. In particular, “The National Security Concept of Mongolia” (Parliament Resolution 48 of 15 July 2010) has Provision 3.6.4.1 saying “Freedom to information shall be sustained by protecting the right to seek, receive, obtain and disseminate information not prohibited by law, and by providing free access to information infrastructure, components and services”; and Provision 3.6.4.5 stating “ Create a favorable environment for mass media outlets to obtain and publish information not prohibited by law”. Furthermore, Provision 2.1.8 of the “National Anti-Corruption Program” (Parliament Resolution 51 of 2016) states “ensure implementation of the law guaranteeing citizen’s right to information”. 

Target definition End the malpractice of denying information, or giving incomplete information, or avoiding giving information by government institutions or public officials under the pretext of secrecy. The legislation on classified information will be aligned with the Constitution of Mongolia and her international treaties.

MN0052,Mongolia,4,5,MNG,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2021,2023,2,NA,"Increased public participation and independent monitoring improves the implementation of the Law on Public Hearing, General Administrative Law, Law on Legislation, Waste Management Law",Improving Implementation of Laws,"Statement of public problem Although the legislation including the Law on Public Hearing, General Administrative Law and the Law on Legislation provide for the responsibility of public institutions to base their decision-making on consultations and consensus with citizens especially those whose interests are to be directly impacted, administrative decisions are still being taken in a manner shunning the legally prescribed duty to ensure their quality through participatory consultative processes. This results in damages to people’s mental and physical life, property and general well-being as well as in breaches of democratic governance values. The Waste Management Law introduces a new management approach but its weak implementation violates the right of urban residents to life in a healthy and safe environment. 

Commitment definition. Align the General Administrative Law (GAL) with the Constitution and the Law on Administrative and Territorial Division of Mongolia to protect the right of the Governor to veto a decision passed by the local assembly. The exercise of this right is contravened by a provision in the GAL which stipulates that a normative act issued by a local assembly be reviewed and submitted to the registration authority in the same period of time as set for normative acts of other entities. This conflict arising from an inappropriate timeframe needs to be resolved and accountability for breach of law enhanced. 

Contribution to addressing public problem 1. Elimination of duplication, gaps and conflicts between the General Administrative Law and other related laws will contribute to consistent Interpretation and implementation of the legislation. 2. Evaluation of the Law on Public Hearing is expected to improve legal guarantees of the right to access to information and participation of relevant populaton groups, communities and public at large in all stages of policy planning and decision-making. 3. Evaluation and strengthened monitoring of the Waste Management Law will contribute to reducing air, water and soil pollution in settlements for the bebefit of the residents’ right to live in healthy and safe environments. 

Relevance to OGP values • Transparency The commitment positively contributes to the policy objective of making government responsive, open and accountable to the people, and to better guarantees of the right of individuals and organizations to file complaints and seek their prompt resolution. • Public participation The commitment will result in the elucidation of the concepts of a request and a complaint,and streamline the request and complaint management procedures for the benefit of the public. • Government accountability The elimination of duplications and gaps in related laws will result in smoother and speedier processing and clearance of requests and complaints filed by individuals and legal entities. 

Additional information Goal Five of the “Vision 2050” Long-Term Development Policy of Mongolia, ratified by Parliament Resolution 52 of 2020, states: “Build a country that is free of corruption and upholds integrity, justice and human rights by developing a human development-oriented smart and stable governance, establishing optimally structured public administration and civil sevice, introducing a digitalized citizen-centered public service delivery, and expanding government-private sector-civil society partnerships in all spheres of life.” 

Target defintion The processes and effects of the Law on Public Hearing, General Administrative Law, Law on the Management of Requests and Complaints Filed by Citizens with Public Institutions or Officials and Waste Management Law will be evaluated, results communicated to government and other parties concerned, and a recommendations implementation plan formulated.

MN0053,Mongolia,4,6,MNG,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2021,2023,2,NA,Increasing public participationin and monitoring of state budget and public investment processes,Increasing Budget Transparency,"Statement of public problem In Mongolia, the increasing poverty rates and diminishing economic freedoms are the adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Fiscal policy is an important poverty reduction tool. With regard to budget planning, approval, implementation and reporting, there is a need to strengthen the application of the principles of “comprehensiveness and accuracy of the budget; efficient financial and fiscal management; fiscal transparency and accountability” as prescribed by the Budget Law of Mongolia. This need for a better implementation of the law is confirmed by the delays in public investment projects which entail yearly project cost overruns and diminished public spending efficiency. In this context, the requirements to the content of budget planning documents must be strengthened. The Government template for public investment projects has been drawn only to show the nominal budget planned for the given financial year, which does not give indication of its percentage in the project’s total budget. This form of presentation interferes with the ability of law makers to verify the comformity of a project budget planning with the law. Furthermore, the initial budgets of multi-year projects are not indicated in the proposal to be approved by parliament. Meanwhile some projects experience significant cost overruns during their life cycles. Such limited information on new and existing public investment projects weakens the ability of parliament members to make informed budget decisions and prevents the public from getting accurate budget information. International Budget Partnership’s Open Budget Survey report highlighted Mongolia’s weakness in budget description. For content comprehensiveness the country scored 30 out of 100 points. Compared to international best practices, Mongolia budget allocation is not classified by economic activity, goals, programs and income sources. Article 22 of the Budget Law dictates that budgets be planned, accordingly executed, recorded and reported in line with the prescribed classification categories. A way to address the issue is the adoption of a well-formulated methodology for the publicly available budget allocation information. It is necessary to complete the work on upgrading the Glass Account Information System and its web platform in conformity with international open data standards and provide the public with systems enabling easy access, downloading and analysis of budget information. Furthermore, a cyber space should be created on the basis of the existing platforms to enable yearround discussions and comments by tax payers and the public at large. 

Commitment definition The following commitments will aim at improving the transparency and accessibility of the state budget and public investment information, and increasing citizen participation in and oversight of the budget process and execution: 1. Amend the legislation towards enhancing the transparency, timeliness and comprehensiveness of the budget process information Provisions supporting the generation and dissemination of transparent, timely and comprehensive information on state budget, public investment, special funds, internatonal assistance finance and all stages of project and program implementation from their inception to closure will be introduced to the budget legislation in the course of this 4th OGP NAP. To do this, analysis of the current legal and regulatory frameworks will be undertaken and proposals developed using multi-stakeholder consultative mechanisms specially set up for the purpose. 2. Glass Account Information System update Strengthen the Glass Account information system with open data standards. The process of improving the shilendans.gov.mn website will involve evaluation and participatory consultations on its design to ensure the data systems operational coherence and orchestration for budget execution transparency. 3. Create a cyber platform where taxpayers and the public freely discuss fiscal policy topics, including state budgeting, public investment and spending, special funds and the use of the international assistance finance A discussion platform will be established on the Glass Account website for the public and taxpayers to discuss and exchange ideas on matters concerning state budget planning and spending throughout the year. Update the publicinvestment.gov.mn website by installing a project “start date” search option. 

Contribution to addressing public problem The commitment will improve the transparency of public budget- and investment project-related information, and the efficiency of public spending by increasing citizen participation in and oversight of the budget process. Thus, it will have a positive impact on stregnthening overall fiscal management, and improving Mongolia’s performance and ranking measured by the Open Budget Index (the IBP) and Corruption Index.

The broad and vague description such as “obviously false” ignores the nature and effects of information impartation, one of which is information distortion, and entails the risk of abuse of law, discriminatory or arbitrary ruling and ultimately the threat of restricting freedom of expression. The Law of Mongolia on Broadcasting, effective since 1 July 2020, does not guarantee independent regulation of the sector and grants the Government full authority for licensing from granting to revoking. Under the Public Radio and Television Management Law, a national broadcaster has been set up with the function of providing the public with objective information free of any political or business interest. However, some provisions of the PRTV Law and problems in its implementation prevent due discharge of this function of delivering impartial and balanced information. Source confidentiality is granted only under the PRTV Law, which creates a situation where reporters working for other media outlets, and particularly investigative journalists are compelled to reveal their source idenditties when summoned to the court of law for their critical reporting. 

Commitment description Strengthen legal guarantees of the freedoms of the press and expression by aligning the aforementioned legislation with international legal norms, in particular with the spirit of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 

Contribution to public problem • Transparency of the activities of public institutions and officials will increase in line with policy objectives and public expectations. • The risk of being groundlessly denied the freedom of expression and the professional duty of independent reporting on the pretext of imparting “obviously false information” will be effectively mitigated . • People’s right to receiving quality information from diverse sources will be strengthened by limiting political interference in the broadcasting sector which has exceptional influence on shaping public opinion • Increased transparency with regard to media owners will help opening up conflicts of interest that bear on the content and quality of information and ultimately be of benefit to people’s right to know. • Institution of clearly defined and effective legal safeguards from overcentralization in the media sector will be conducive to nurturing pluralistic media serving the public as a source of diverse information. 

Relevance to OGP values ● Transparency The commitment aims at supporting public right to know by strenghtneing the basis of transparency, availability and diversity of information . ● Public participation The commitment is to ensure the public’s right to receive information on government decision-making and thereby contribute to the public’s capacity to influence policy decisions. ● Government accountability The commitment is to improve availability of information that is essential for bringing government accountability mechanisms into effect.

MN0057,Mongolia,5,1,MNG,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2023,2027,4,NA,Advancing extractive industry transparency,Advancing Extractive Industry Transparency,"What problem does the commitment aim to address? Natural resource activities, public control over revenue management and governance through transparency, increase accountability, and reduce the risk of corruption and conflicts of interest. 

What are the causes of the problem? Mineral resources sector, particularly operational activities of state-owned companies, face high risk of corruption and conflict of interests. Irresponsible mining operations, environmental and human rights violations are influencing in unsupportive attitude towards mining, and becoming the source of misunderstandings and conflicts among local community and society. The implementation of the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, which has been successfully implemented by Mongolia since 2006, has clearly weakened in recent years due to the fact that the duties and responsibilities of the public and private sectors related to ensuring transparency are not guaranteed by law. Translucency in transparency and governance is reducing competitiveness and showing negative impact to the investment. 

What has been done so far to solve the problem? Concept paper of the Law on the Extractive Industries Transparency has been approved. The Ministry of Mining and Heavy Industry drafted the Law on the Extractive Industries Transparency in 2020, however the draft was not submitted to the parliament. This is the third draft. The Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs additionally included the issue of ensuring transparency of other natural resources, such as land, forests, water to the minerals issues and amended draft to the Law on the Extractive Industries Transparency and currently receiving public comments on the draft. 

What solution are you proposing? 1.The government will be responsible to implement corresponding activities to ensure transparency; 2.Legislate the composition and operation of an integrated database for the extractive industry transparency and link it to the state open database; 3.Define the functions of government institutions related to the formation of the database; 4.Ensure the transparency of the beneficial ownership in the extractive industry; 5.Ensure transparency of the contract; 6.The transparency of the National Wealth Fund activities, income and expenses shall be legalized; 7.Ensure transparency for state-owned legal entities operating in the extractive industry; 8.Determining the alternation of mineral and oil licensing areas, granting special licenses, signing contracts related to the use of natural resources, approving exploration results reports, technical and economic evaluations, and granting land and water use licenses, all decision-making process will be legislated to ensure transparency; 9.Establish civic engagement mechanisms to ensure transparency, determine industry policy, and monitor the implementation of law. 10. Complete activities to ensure transparency and clarify the financial sources. In determining national and local budgets, policies and regulations for the extractive industry, conditions will be created to oversee industry information, calculations, and research. 11. Determine the responsibility for the violation of the duty to ensure transparency. 

What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment?

MN0060,Mongolia,5,4,MNG,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2023,2027,4,NA,Ensure media freedom to strengthen democracy,Ensuring Media Freedom and Freedom of Expression,"What problem does the commitment aim to address? The values of open government partnership, such as encouraging open government, empowering citizens, and fighting corruption will be fulfilled in reality, civil rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution of Mongolia will be ensured, and will make a valuable contribution to the expansion of civic space such as the media. 

What are the causes of the problem? Violations, such as refusal to provide information, harassment or threats shown based on written articles and programs, attacks on work tools, banning or attempted banning of articles, programs, and media, forcing disclosure of confidential sources are occurring. The Government lists confidential information within its internal organization and it is defined in general. This creates conditions for the organizations to formulate the information as “secret” through its own censorship and to prevent the acquisition and dissemination of information. Violations that prohibit articles and programs before the publication or introduction are manifested by the influence of the owner of the media organization, authorized officials, fellow journalists, and closed agreements. 

What has been done so far to solve the problem? In recent years, the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs has drafted relevant laws to improve the Law on Freedom of Media, laws related to state secrets, and laws related to freedom of demonstration, assembly, and expression. 

What solution are you proposing? In order to ensure the transparency of information, abolish and regulate the restrictions on non-disclosure of information on the grounds of state secrets, we need to study the current situation of the media industry, identify stakeholders, evaluate the place occupied by civil society and the private sector, develop a road map for future collaboration, improve the process of information ethical responsibility, encourage investigative journalism locally, protect sources, and support the rights of expression, speech, march and assembly. 

What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? Implementation of the above commitments will progress the guaranteed enjoyment of the rights and freedoms of speech, expression, search, receive, store, and distribution of information, demonstration and assembly. Capacity of media organizations will be strengthened.

Commitment
The issue at stake Lack of targeted, well-systematised and usable data on the Open Data portal to enable business start-ups to access information and data helpful for starting a business and its market positioning. Integrity refers to lawful, independent, impartial, accountable and transparent exercise of duties by public officials and other public employees preserving their own and the institution’s reputation. Over the last 10 or so years the NGO Centre for Democratic Transition developed the openness index for executive, legislative and judicial authorities, as well as for local self-governments. The findings indicate that for many years the executive branch in Montenegro has been the regional leader in openness at the level of the Government, line ministries and other state administration authorities. Recently, however, we have observed some deteriorations in certain segments. There is no systemic monitoring in place for the implementation of the Guidelines for creating electronic documents in line with e-accessibility standards, developed by the MPA in collaboration with the Association of the Blind of Montenegro, and consistent with the Government commitments for protection of persons with 
disabilities. On the other hand, there is still a limited accessibility of formats for persons with disabilities, thus restricting their access to administrative services.
Commitment This commitment implies the creation of more open data to foster intra- and inter-sector communications, particularly to provide better public information in various areas of public interest. A survey of business start-ups is needed to understand the type and structure of data to be posted on the open data portal that would facilitate the process of starting a business, add value at the market and share information with other stakeholders. Set up a separate section for start-ups as generators of future growth and strengthening of the MSME sector. To deliver on this commitment the amendments to the Decree on State Administration Setup and Method of Operation are needed to set the criteria/standards to have consistent openness of the executive branch horizontally and vertically in reference to: regular and consistent date publication and updates in the open data format, greater budget transparency, user-friendliness and accessibility. Public administration integrity and public trust in institutions will be enhanced through preparation and publication of electronically readable publications. Accessible contents at webpages of state institutions, i.e. e-services they offer and the e-document available online, are important steps towards digital equity. Legal review of free access to information provisions, with guides for improvements in terms of both legislation and implementation to be subsequently used for drafting amendments to the Free Access to Information Law.
How will it help address the issue Collection, classification and distribution of open data through a single centralised point ensures greater openness and new opportunities for citizens and businesses to create new value from the data available. By opening data, government fosters the development of creative businesses and knowledge-based economy, and in return it gets the feedback that can be used for improving data quality.
Availability of relevant data for business start-ups at a single place is an important resource for new entrants in the market, but also for those seeking jobs through autonomy and innovation. Such a database is needed to address that issue and serve as a firm foundation for promoting and fostering new business opportunities. Regulation of the matters affecting transparency of the government will contribute to its greater integrity, and the consistent implementation would respond to the needs of stakeholders, i.e. citizens as end users – to systematically publish data of general interest by unifying practices and standards for all state administration authorities. Availability of electronically readable government data is an additional indicator of its openness. The right to freely access information held by public authorities is an important aspect of a democracy. Citizens are entitled to true and timely information on matters affecting their lives and their environment, and have the right to participate in decision-making. The full implementation of the Free Access to Information Law is seen in tis oversight function, since citizens and other entities may have direct insight into the operation of public authorities and the work of officials, as one of the tools to prevent negligence, misconduct, abuse of office and corruption.
Its relevance to OGP values The delivery on this commitment is yet another indicator of transparency seen in publication of more highvalue and easily accessible information, primarily for the purpose of public information as a precondition for and one form of public participation in policy-making and other stages of policy life. Moreover, having legislative regulation in place implies accountability of all those obliged to apply the relevant provisions. The delivery on this commitment would add to transparency and accountability of public authorities and enhance the constitutionally enshrined right to freedom of information.
Additional information Compatibility with SDGs Reference to SDG 16: ‘Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions’ 16.6 – Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels 16.10 – Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements. The actions to be undertaken within the framework of this commitment will contribute to increasing access and use of public information and data with the aim of increasing public administration transparency and accountability.

This measure responds to the problem of still insufficient compliance of the legal framework for the protection of whistleblowers with the EU Directive 2019/1937 on the protection of persons who report violations of Union law. By adopting the Law on Prevention of Corruption, Montenegro joined the group of European countries in which the treatment of whistleblowers is systematically regulated by the legislative framework. In the previous period, the Agency particularly recognized the importance of amending the existing Law on the Prevention of Corruption, through the elimination of the shortcomings of the existing legal framework, recognized through almost seven years of practice, with the necessary harmonization with the EU Acquis, then within the Project for the fight against economic crime in Montenegro , in cooperation with the Council of Europe and with the support of international experts, began a comprehensive analysis of this law, which is carried out in three phases. The first phase of this project, which refers to the functional independence of the Agency, was completed with the preparation of the Technical Document ""Analysis of the parts of the Law on the Prevention of Corruption that regulate the establishment and work of the Agency for the Prevention of Corruption"". The second phase is in progress, in which the parts of the Law related to conflicts of interest and reports on income and assets are analyzed, while the third phase, planned for the first quarter of next year, will analyze the parts of the Law related to whistleblowers, integrity and misdemeanor provisions. The government's mid-term work program plans to establish the Law on Amendments to the Law on Prevention of Corruption in the second quarter of 2024, when the legal framework for the protection of whistleblowers is also expected to be harmonized. Namely, with the entry into force of the aforementioned EU Directive, space is opened for further improvement of the legislative framework through the drafting of a special Law on the Protection of Whistleblowers (Montenegro is the only country in the region that does not have a separate Law on Whistleblowers), in order to implement novelties and achieve the necessary harmonization with EU legal acquis, and recognized the role and importance of whistle-blowers in the legal system of Montenegro. It is necessary, through consultations with the interested public, when amending the legal framework, to consider how monitoring and reporting can be improved, and to introduce the obligation to keep gender-based statistics on whistle-blower reports, as well as records by other demographic characteristics that could help in the analysis and monitoring of certain trends in this area. 

What does this measure entail? The measure includes activities to harmonize the legal framework, which will improve the protection of whistleblowers, as an important element in the fight against corruption at all levels.

In what way does the measure contribute to the solution of the identified public problem? It is expected that through the expansion of the application of the legal framework for the protection of whistleblowers to other economic companies that are not owned by the state, this important mechanism in the fight against corruption will be further strengthened. 

Why is this measure relevant in relation to the values promoted through the OGP initiative? This measure is directly relevant to the values of transparency and openness of public administration, as well as strengthening the responsibility of institutions in the implementation of anti-corruption measures. 

Additional information The implementation of this measure should contribute to the realization of the UN's sustainable development goals, especially goal 16 (Peace, justice and strong institutions) and related tasks 16.5 Significantly reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms and 16.6 - building effective, responsible and transparent institution. In addition, the measure is complementary to the fulfillment of obligations from the EU accession negotiations, especially for Chapter 23 (judiciary and fundamental rights).

Commitment description
What is the public problem that the commitment will address?
Currently, public services are framed by different legal mechanisms (laws, decrees, circulars, orders, and memos). In many cases, these legislative texts are not respected: when it involves additional rules and stakeholders, requests for supporting documentation and fees, etc. Furthermore, rules related to public services are not always openly published and accessible to the public. This situation creates an imbalanced relationship between the citizen and the administration, which leads to abuse of power and corrupt practices. This situation can be avoided by setting a regulatory framework that requires government bodies to transcribe terms and 
conditions as well as rules, and necessary steps for public service delivery. They will help citizens react to any difference or discrepancy between the provision of an administrative service and what has been published. 
What is the commitment?
The commitment involves provisions to be included in the public services charter, stated in Article 157 of the Constitution, which will: Require government bodies to transcribe terms and conditions, as well as rules and steps necessary for public service delivery, using a uniform and standardised model, posted on the national public services portal  Enforce the publication of what has been transcribed on the national public services portal and any other available medium to enable users to obtain the information they need. This will help them perform an act or access a public service  Update data on public services posted on the national public services portal following any change or modification  Ensure the respect of terms, conditions and rules related to public services published on the national public services portal or any other means of official communication or publication; see the “Principle of Enforceability”  Require public servants, in charge of delivering public services, to perform their tasks in a way that respects what has been communicated to users through the national public services portal or any other official means of publication or posting  Enable users to react to any difference or discrepancy between the delivery of a public service and what has been published. This commitment will also: Establish a binding legal framework for government bodies with regard to public services delivered.  Improve the transparency of the services provided by government bodies  Force government bodies to remedy any abuses resulting from the non-respect of services published on the national public services portal ""service-public.ma"".
How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem?
The implementation of this commitment will provide a binding legal framework. Its application will force government bodies to normalise publish and respect public services, subject to sanctions. Thus, citizens will make sure that services consulted will be respected. If not, they will have legal guarantees to enforce the respect of these rules. 
Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?
The relevance of this commitment arises from the obligation to ensure transparency of public services delivered by each government body on the one hand, and to transcribe and publish all public services provided to users on the web portal “servicepublic.ma”, on the other. Thus, government bodies must provide users with reliable, clear information about public services delivery, thereby enabling them to react to any difference or discrepancy from what has been
published. This commitment would also push for better accountability as it enables service users to demand the public administration to respect the established guidelines.

MO0043,Morocco,2,19,MAR,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2021,2023,2,Citizen Participation,Strengthening citizen participation through the implementation of legal frameworks related to public consultation and contractual volunteering,Implement Legal Frameworks on Public Consulation and Volunteering,"CHALLENGE The absence of a legal framework on public consultation, for the implementation of articles 12 and 13 of the Moroccan Constitution of 2011, and this legal void leads to a dispersion of the State’s efforts in this field. This also leads to the disparity in the methodology for organizing public consultation activities by public administrations and elected institutions. As a result, civil society organizations are unable to adequately participate in the process of preparation, monitoring and evaluation of decisions, projects and public policies; The absence of a specific legal framework that regulates volunteering in Morocco and that stipulates the rights and obligations of volunteers as well as entities that organize the volunteering work.

PROPOSED SOLUTION 1. Preparation and submission of the draft law on public consultation to the legislative procedure for approval in order to : • ▪Introduce the modalities of participation of civil society organizations and citizens in the preparation, monitoring and evaluation of decisions and public policies through mechanisms of dialogue and consultation • ▪Adopt specific provisions on the rights, commitments and obligations of stakeholders involved in the public consultation process, while specifying the principles and objectives on which the process is based. 2. Preparation and submission of the draft law on contractual volunteering to the legislative procedure for approval in order to: • ▪Regulate contractual volunteering, by specifying the duties of entities organizing the contractual volunteering towards the volunteers, and the commitments of the volunteers towards these entities. Additionally, it should define the process for issuing and terminating a volunteering contract. It should also include provisions for national coordination and international cooperation in the field of contractual volunteering; • Put in place legal provisions to strengthen the effective participation of youth in particular, and citizens in general, in community development, and create a dynamic in favor of volunteer work. It is worth noting that during the year 2020, a large consultation was conducted with many government departments, constitutional institutions and civil society organizations about the draft law on contractual volunteering. The results of these consultancy meetings were collected and analyzed along with international best practices in order to elaborate the first version of the draft law on volunteerism. 

EXPECTED RESULTS Encourage the participation of civil society organizations, citizens and social actors in public decision-making. These organizations should be also committed to take into consideration the outcomes of public consultation processes; • Promotion of the practice of public consultation in a transparent, credible, effective and beneficial manner for decision making; • Promotion of the effective participation of citizens in societal development and create a dynamic of support for the consolidation of the contractual volunteer work ; • ▪Encourage citizens to participate in public action, to contribute to the development of intangible capital, to create wealth, and to support public policy priorities in all its dimensions; • ▪Strengthen trust and solidarity among members of society, which will contribute to achieving the sustainable and integrated human development goals; • Encourage young people to volunteer • Open new horizons for large and dynamic volunteering and for community life .

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Number of consultative events with government departments, public institutions, constitutional institutions and civil society organizations in order to elaborate draft laws on public consultation and volunteering ; • Percentage of recommendations received from the above-mentioned consultative meetings that were included in the two draft laws ; • ▪Approval of the two draft laws by the Secretariat-General of the Government ; • ▪Adoption of the two proposed draft laws by the Council of Government ; • ▪Submission of the two proposed draft laws to the Parliament.

IMPACT INDICATORS Number of organized public consultation operations ; • Rate of public consultation outcomes taken into account ; • Number of volunteering contracts that have been issued.

The Political Parties Act (Wet op de politieke partijen, Wpp, in dutch) will further increase transparency about the financing of political parties and political campaigns. 

What is the commitment? The proposal for the Wpp will be presented to the House of Representatives. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? If the parliament adopts the proposal for the Wpp, transparency about the funding of national parties will be increased. Binding rules on (digital) political campaigns and the funding of decentralized political parties will be introduced. 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? With this commitment, the functioning of political parties is being made more transparent for citizens. This contributes to increasing accountability of the politicalparties and to increasing confidence in the government and strengthens democracy.

Increase the transparency of the beneficial ownership of New Zealand companies and limited partnerships by introducing legislation to make beneficial owners’ identifying information available on a public register. 

Ambition

To establish a register of beneficial ownership of companies and limited partnerships to help people find accurate, up-to-date information about who they are doing business with. The register will hold biographical, contact, and corporate information about the beneficial owners of New Zealand companies and limited partnerships. Companies and limited partnerships will be required to inform the registrar who their beneficial owners are. Beneficial owners will be required to provide their information to the registrar. Beneficial owners will need to prove their identity when providing this information and will be issued with a unique identifier. Subject to safeguards, enforcement agencies will be able to access all register information while the general public will have access to high-level information (name, date of becoming a beneficial owner, and grounds for qualifying as a beneficial owner). 

Status Quo

Companies and limited partnerships are two of the most common ‘for profit’ entities in New Zealand. These entities are only required to disclose information to the Companies Office about individuals who directly own, and who directly run, the entities. There is no legal obligation to disclose the individuals who ultimately own or control companies and limited partnerships (the ‘beneficial owners’). The current level of disclosure makes it difficult to determine, for instance, who is benefiting when public funds go to private entities, whether entities are paying the correct amount of tax, or if they may be involved in money- laundering or other forms of corruption. 

Te Tiriti o Waitangi

Increase the transparency of the beneficial ownership of New Zealand companies and limited may benefit Māori as both citizens and iwi, to the extent that the current lack of transparency around beneficial ownership of companies and limited partnerships can have an impact on Māori as citizens and iwi due to systemic inequality and disadvantage.

OGP Values: Transparency, Integrity, and Accountability

NG0020,Nigeria,2,6,NGA,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2019,2022,3,Anti-corruption,To establish a public register of beneficial owners of corporate entities,Establish Beneficial Ownership Registry,"Brief description:
The establishment of a public register of beneficial owners of corporate entities will enable the relevant authorities mandated to curb corruption, identify natural persons who directly or indirectly own, control or enjoy the benefits of the corporate entity.

General problem:
Anonymous/shell companies constitute potential and real dangers to the economy and security of the countries where they operate. These companies deny the countries of valuable revenue through tax avoidance, mask links to corruption, money laundering, drug trafficking and terrorism financing. People use proxies and fronts to register companies and the legal owners are usually not those who control and benefit from the companies. Politically exposed persons also use their influence to confer advantages to themselves through such companies.

Specific OGP issue: 
Corruption, Opacity in the utilization and management of public resources

Rationale for the commitment:
The identification of beneficial owners of corporate entities will discourage corruption and enable the government to trace and curb illicit financial flows, empowering citizens to be part of anti-corruption.

Main objective:
To put in place a system that enables openness, transparency and full disclosure of beneficial ownership information.

Anticipated impact:
Increase in valuable revenue through tax avoidance and reduction in money laundering, drug trafficking and terrorism financing.
Suggested impact – Reduced loses of public resources

This commitment is to strengthen Nigerian laws with regards to assets recovery, especially non-conviction-based confiscation powers and unexplained wealth orders; and ensure proper management of assets and proceeds.

General problem: 
1.        Absence of a comprehensive legislative framework for the management of asset recovery
2.        Poor asset recovery management

Specific OGP issue:
Corruption, Opacity in the utilization and management of public resources

Rationale for the commitment:
Asset recovery is an integral part of anti-corruption work. It requires a good legislative framework and proper management of assets and proceeds. Asset recovery and management is a huge challenge in Nigeria. There were reported cases in the past where recovered assets have not been properly managed leading to “looting of looted funds.” This commitment was made in the first NAP. Progress was made such as submission of the Proceeds of the Crime Bill to the National Assembly. But It has not been passed into law. There is the need to continue with the commitment so as to strengthen the legislative framework and improve the management of assets and proceeds.

Main objective:
To enact legislation that would aid asset recovery and ensure proper and transparent management of assets and proceeds

Anticipated impact:
To deter looting of public resources
Easy asset recovery and management

This commitment will ensure that citizens and citizen organisations can inform and influence government policies and actions through their freedom to associate, assemble and express themselves freely thereby encouraging constant partnership between the public, private and third sector. 

General problem:
Freedom of association, assembly and expression while moderate in Nigeria, citizens are beginning to witness increased attacks on journalists, bloggers, online influencers and human rights defenders who voice concern or report government failings or are against policies, failure to respect citizens’ rights to protests and assemblies and proposals on civil society regulatory frameworks/laws/regulations capable of creating barriers to independent and efficient operation of formal civil society organisations. 

Specific OGP issue:
1.        Low level of citizens voices in the policy making process.
2.        Weak safeguards against undue arrest of citizens and non-state actors. 
3.        Weak citizens and civil society engagement in all levels of government decision-making.
4.        Weak civil society-government relationship. 

Rationale for the commitment:
Many of the OGP commitments will benefit from an open civic space for its success, for example opening government systems and processes, curbing corruption and illicit flows cannot be felt government-wide without active citizens, media and nonstate actors that can use data and information to hold governments accountable. Citizens cannot provide information to government on its policies and programmes where the fear of arrest, gagging and restrictions exists on their ability to speak freely and openly.  The public cannot voice or discuss public interest issues freely when there are restrictions on their ability to assemble and or protest. 

Main objective:
To ensure that citizens and citizen organisations can freely assemble, associate and express their opinions on government policies and programmes. 

Anticipated impact:
Improved citizens participation and enabling the environment for advocacy, including working collectively towards open and responsive government, guaranteed protection of basic civil liberties such freedom of association, assembly and expression.

The commitment is aimed at strengthening and institutionalizing the operational capacity of SERVICOM to enforce strict compliance to service charters for all MDAs and SERVICOM’s reporting mechanism.

General problem:
SERVICOM currently has very little statutory powers to enforce compliance with public service rules and regulations. The lack of a SERVICOM law makes the articulation and implementation of existing Service Charters ineffective.

Specific OGP issue:
The SERVICOM law will provide the legal framework to ensure the responsiveness of government through strict compliance with service charters by MDAs. It will also contain a mandatory reporting requirement for MDAs to make periodic reports to SERVICOM.

Rationale for the commitment:
To provide SERVICOM with the legal framework to serve as a statutory body with the responsibility of tracking/monitoring and supporting quality service delivery.

Main objective:
For SERVICOM staff to have the legal backing to sanction those that violate public service rules and regulations and ensure that work ethics are observed within the organizations.

NG0032,Nigeria,3,2,NGA,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2023,2025,2,Fiscal Transparency,To ensure an effective and participatory audit that completes the budget cycle and enhances transparency and accountability,Creation of Supreme Audit Institution with Participatory Mechanisms,"Brief Description of Commitment: To strengthen public financial management in Nigeria through effective Institutional reforms of the legal framework guiding audit processes and creation of supreme audit institution. 

General Problem / Challenge Addressed by the Commitment: The legal framework for public auditing at the federal level in Nigeria is obsolete and requires repealing and enactment of a new Audit Law to create an independent supreme audit institution. Also, there is lack of citizens participation in the audit process and lack of transparency in the activities of Public Accounts Committees in the National Assembly. These gaps hinder accountability in the management of public resources in Nigeria. 

Specific OGP Issue(s) in Focus: 1. Absence of citizens' participation in the audit process. 2. Inefficient and ineffective management and utilization of public resources. 3. Poor delivery of public services. 4. Low budget performance. 5. Weak accountability mechanism. 

Rationale for the Commitment: Enacting a new Audit Law will strengthen the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation and guarantee its financial, operational, and administrative independence to perform its constitutional functions of ensuring accountability in the management of public resources. This will also aid citizens participation in the audit process and improve transparency in the activities of Public Accounts Committees 

Main Objective: To ensure that government spending and processes adhere to the strict compliance of approved budget and that all extant rules of government in the decision-making process and disbursement of public funds. 

Anticipated Impact: Improved transparency and accountability in the budget process through independent and participatory audit of government expenditure, processes, and outcomes.

NG0043,Nigeria,3,12,NGA,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2023,2025,2,Civic Participation and Inclusion,"To create the space for citizens and citizen organizations, human right defenders and the media to thrive, express themselves and participate in the different stages of the policy making process without fear or intimidation",Strengthening Enabling Environment for Citizens and CSOs,"Brief Description of Commitment: This commitment will ensure that citizens and citizen organizations can inform and influence government policies and actions through their freedom to associate, assemble and express themselves freely thereby encouraging constant partnership between the public, private and third sector. 

General Problem / Challenge Addressed by the Commitment: Freedom of association, assembly and expression while moderate in Nigeria, citizens are beginning to witness increased attacks on journalists, bloggers, online influencers and human rights defenders who voice concern or report government failings or are against policies, failure to respect citizens' rights to protests and assemblies and proposals on civil society regulatory frameworks/laws/regulations capable of creating barriers to independent and efficient operation of formal civil society organizations. This is worsened by the increasing and unregulated use of digital surveillance technologies by federal and state governments to invade citizens' privacy and spy on human rights defenders. 

Specific OGP Issue(s) in Focus: 1. Low level of citizens voices in the policy making process. 2. Weak safeguards against undue arrest of citizens and non-state actors. 3. Weak citizens and civil society engagement at all levels of government decision-making. 4. Weak civil society-government relationship. 5. Inadequate attention to vulnerable citizens 6. Weak/ non-engagement of host communities, especially by extractive corporations/ industries (Business and human Rights). 7. Inadequate attention to issues of terrorism and insurgency.

Rationale for the Commitment: Many of the OGP commitments will benefit from an open civic space for its success, for example opening government systems and processes, curbing corruption and illicit flows cannot be felt without active citizens, media and nonstate actors that can use data and information to hold governments accountable. Citizens cannot provide information to the government on its policies and programmes where the fear of arrest, gagging and restrictions exists on their ability to speak freely and openly. The public cannot voice or discuss public interest issues freely when there are restrictions on their ability to assemble and / or protest. 

Main Objective: To ensure that citizens and citizen organizations can freely assemble, associate and express their opinions on government policies and programmes, and other issues that affect their livelihood and well-being. Anticipated Impact: Improved citizens participation and enabling the environment for advocacy, including working collectively towards open and responsive government, guaranteed protection of basic civil liberties such as freedom of association, assembly and expression.

NG0040,Nigeria,3,13,NGA,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2023,2025,2,Improved Service Delivery,"Institutionalization of SERVICOM operations using legal, legislative or Executive Instrument",Institutionalization of SERVICOM Operations,"Brief Description of Commitment: The commitment is aimed at strengthening and institutionalizing the operational capacity of SERVICOM to enforce strict compliance to service charters for all MDAs and SERVICOM's reporting mechanism. 

General Problem / Challenge Addressed by the Commitment: SERVICOM currently has very little statutory powers to enforce compliance with public service rules and regulations. The lack of a SERVICOM law makes the articulation and implementation of existing Service Charters ineffective. While work has commenced in advocating the passage of a bill for an act to establish and institutionalize SERVICOM, there is a need to build on existing efforts to achieve a legal framework. 

Specific OGP Issue(s) in Focus: The SERVICOM law will provide the legal framework to ensure the responsiveness of government through strict compliance with service charters by MDAs. It will also contain a mandatory reporting requirement for MDAs to make periodic reports to SERVICOM. 

Rationale for the Commitment: For SERVICOM to have the legal backing to sanction public servants and public organisations who do not comply with the laid down requirements of providing the public with qualitative services, in line with published service charters. 

Main Objective: To provide SERVICOM with the legal framework to serve as a statutory body with the responsibility of tracking/monitoring and supporting quality service delivery. Anticipated Impact: Improved legal framework to enforce compliance towards improving satisfaction and access to public services and goods by the citizens.

Expected Outcomes Milestones (Performance Indicators)

Public information holders, as main factors in the commitments implementation, still are not sufficiently transparent in their operation, and do not publish available information on their websites, document in their possession are not completely available for the citizens and public information applicants. Civil sector directs its activities toward improvement of the Law on Free Access to Public Information implementation, by analysis and pro-active publication of public information on the holders’ websites, developing and conducting campaigns and trainings for citizens, promoting the right to free access to public information. Main objective: Affirmation and improvement of the access to public information through a cooperation and joint promotion of the right to access to information, supported by the government and civil sectors. Brief description of commitment: Improvement of the access to information through pro-active public information publishing, taking measures for increased access to public information, information for the citizens, as well as improvement of the Law on  Free Access to Public Information are the key factors in the Law implementation and the constitutionally guaranteed right (Article 16 of the Constitution of the RM). OPG challenge addressed by the commitment: Better implementation of the Law on Free Access to Public Information with active involvement of the information holders and citizens.  Reference to the global objectives of sustainable development: Reference to the Objective 16. “Peace, justice and strong institutions” Target 16.10: Ensuring access to information and protection of the fundamental freedoms, in agreement with the national legislative and international agreements. Measures of this commitment contribute for improving access, use and trends following in respect of public information and data. Relevance: Good cooperation practice between the public information holders and the civil sector is the key for better government and important factor for transparent work and implementation of the right to free access to public information. Affirmation and improvement of the established practices and procedures for policy creating in respect of the access to public information, supported by the information holders and the civil sector, are the basis for advancement of transparency and responsibility of the Commission for protection of the free access to public information. Ambition: Cooperation with the information holders and civil sector has a great contribution to better implementation of the Law, transparency, openness and accountability of the institutions and their functioning, building mutual confidence, and development of quality democracy.

Description of commitment 
Status quo or problem addressed by the commitment 
One of the ways to reduce the illegal wealth of the elected and appointed persons as a result of their function is a functional mechanism that will monitor these conditions. In Macedonia, this system is relatively inefficient, primarily due to technical reasons, which leaves room for arbitrary operations of the competent institutions. The SCPC monitors the sources of the property of state officials during their terms of service in a limited manner. At the same time, the SCPC does not have complete insight whether all elected and appointed persons have submitted asset declarations because the register of appointed and elected persons has not yet met its function for which the same was established. Namely, apart from the institutions, the citizens are denied the opportunity to have full insight into who are the elected and appointed persons in the state, and what is the property state and how it changes as a result of the public function.
Main objective 
Establishing a functional system that will simplify the checking of the property status of the elected and appointed persons and will provide the citizens with adequate insight into it.
Brief description of the commitment 
Based on the analysis of the anti-corruption legislation, and by virtue of the already existing information of the SCPC, but also of the civil society, an audit will be conducted in order to upgrade the functionality of the registry. This will be a basis for qualitative overview of the filled-in data of the Register under SCPC’s competence. In the meantime, the SCPC will put into effect the connection between the electronic registration of asset declarations, the publication of the same and the register. In addition, the SCPC will create a legal basis for redefining the content and the manner of submitting the asset declaration with the amendments to the Law on prevention of corruption. SCPC, along with other competent institutions such as Public Revenue Office, Employment Agency of RM, Cadastre, Central Register of RM, Securities and Exchange Commission, Ministry of Interior, will put into operation the interoperability system as one of the tools for systematic monitoring of property during the performance of the function.

State Commission for Preventing Corruption 
Description of commitment 
Status quo or problem addressed by the commitment 
Unjustified discretionary authorizations, gaps in laws and uncertainties are potential risks of corruption. They allow exploitation of the meaning of the law and abuse of the rules due to exercising private interests. The anti-corruption assessment of the legislation, as an extremely important preventive anticorruption mechanism, aims to provide revision of the form and content of legal regulations that are in drafting procedures or are already adopted, as well as detection and prevention of risks regarding the possibility of corruption and conflict of interest which could occur during the implementation of the laws. In September 2015, the SCPC has adopted the Methodology for Anti-Corruption assessment of legislation that promotes the implementation of the SCPC's competence for giving opinions on draft laws, set out in the Law on Prevention of Corruption and the Law on Prevention of Conflicts of Interest. In February 2016, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has adopted the Rules of Procedure for amending the Rules of Procedure of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (""Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia"" No. 41/16), which introduced an opportunity for anticorruption verification of legislation by providing an opinion from SCPC. The amendment stipulates that the ministries and other state administration bodies, the materials that they submit to the Government for review, determination, or adoption, must be submitted to the SCPC for opinion (all draft laws that are subject to regulatory impact assessment). Within this authorization, the SCPC conducts an in-depth analysis of the legislation on the grounds of established methodology, i.e. conducts anticorruption assessment and provides special reports on the assessment made, which are published on the website of the SCPC. 
Main objective 
Realization of collaboration with the civil sector in the process of anticorruption assessment of the legislation
Brief description of the commitment
SCPC and civil society organizations will develop a mechanism for collaboration in the consultative processes during the law adoption, as well as in the process of selection and prioritization of the laws that have already been adopted, and will be subject to anti-corruption assessment of the legislation. In accordance with the Anti-Corruption Legislation Methodology, the SCPC will select and prioritize laws that will be subject to assessment on the grounds of common criteria or seperate cases. Separate cases relate to findings reporting and indications by civil society, concerning the risks of possible corruption and conflict of interests in certain legal provisions or in a particular legal area, information on a draftlaw that has been exposed to strong lobbying by interest groups, etc. CSOs and their networks should be proactive and more active at this stage - by participating in working groups, then at the level of consultations, when they can send comments on behalf of the groups they represent, but also by providing indications to the SCPC and giving recommendations legislation amendments. 
OGP challenge addressed by the commitment 
Undertaking activities that will continually point out the importance of civil society organizations and the public’s inclusion in the process of adopting and amending the laws, emphasizing the benefits of such an approach, and indicating out the positive effects of the laws that were adopted through a transparent process in which recommendations and proposals by CSO’s have been accepted. In addition to anti-corruption assessment of legislation which is in a process of adoption, it is extremely important to give due attention to the already adopted rules. Cooperation with the non-governmental sector, i.e. the development of a consultation mechanism, will help the selection and focus process that will be revised, based on the civil sector assessments regarding risk legislative areas. Recommendations given by the civil sector will be incorporated in the regulatory amendments.

Description of commitment 
Status quo or problem addressed by the commitment 
The right to access to justice is one of the fundamental human rights. The exercise of this right is connected and depends on the availability of legal services for all citizens, regardless of their material and social position. Access to justice for all citizens depends on the efficiency and quality of the free legal aid system, as the only form recognized
by the Ministry of Justice, while for some of the poor and marginalized groups of citizens it depends on informal forms of legal assistance (legal aid, judicial representation and paralegal assistance) provided by civil society organizations. The results of the survey on legal needs of the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia indicate that every second citizen of the Republic of Macedonia is facing a legal problem. The problem is the fact that many citizens do not recognize whether the problem is legal and do not know where to turn to. Research on the legal needs of certain marginalized groups (Roma, drug users, and sex workers) indicate that these citizens, due to marginalization and stigmatization, are additionally disabled in recognizing and resolving the legal problems they face. The lack of trust in institutions, insufficient information and ignorance and the unfavorable social and economic situation are the most common problems due to which the citizens coming from poor and marginalized communities have difficulty in accessing justice.
Main objective 
Effective access to quality, efficient and complementary communitybased legal services
Brief description of the commitment 
Once the Law on Free Legal Assistance enters into force, the Ministry of Justice, together with FOSM, will conduct a National Survey of Citizens' Legal Needs in order to develop a plan or strategy for legal strengthening in accordance with previously obtained findings. The plan, or strategy, will be prepared by the ministry in cooperation with CSOs and Free legal aid providers, paralegal assistance and other legal services models. The Ministry of Justice, in partnership with CSOs will finance and maintain the existing databases and the website www.pravnozajakni.mk which contains information on all forms of legal assistance and equal access to justice for all citizens. Furthermore, in collaboration with CSOs, the Ministry will develop a methodology for assessing the capacities and quality of the provided free legal aid by the regional departments, as well as a methodology for monitoring the implementation of the Law on Free Legal Assistance, as well as conducting a campaign aimed at raising awareness among citizens regarding the right to free legal assistance.

RNM lacks statistics on the number of mobbing victims. Based on ILO’s research, more than 4% of workers are subject to psychological violence, 2% to sexual harassment and 8% to intimidation and harassment. Taking into account these statistics, it could be assessed that around 111,936 of the total number of employees in RNM are victims of mobbing. From 2013, when the Law on Protection against Harassment in the Workplace was adopted, there have been only two initiated and successfully resolved cases, and one case is pending. According to data from the toll-free line for reporting harassment in the workplace, 65 calls for assistance and support were recorded over a period of two months in 2020, with more than half of them being made by women. This situation is due to insufficient information among workers about this phenomenon, including available protection mechanisms. Mediators in mobbing cases appointed at employers are insufficiently educated about their place and role within the system for protection of 72 workers. Moreover the country has not fully adopted international treaties and mechanisms on this subject matter, i.e. it has not ratified ILO Convention 190 and Recommendation 206, and has failed to organize consultations with all stakeholders for development of legal solutions to this phenomenon. 

Main objective of the commitment The commitment’s main objective is to improve the already established mechanism for protection against harassment in the workplace. 

How will the commitment contribute to addressing the public problem? Implementation of this commitment will enable information dissemination to employees about their rights to protection against mobbing arising from the Law on Labour Relations and education for selected independent persons appointed as mediators in procedures for resolution of mobbing cases, which have not been covered in systematic manner thus far, ratification of the International Labour Organization’s Convention 190 and Recommendation 206, establishment of electronic and public system for reporting and monitoring status and implementation of all proceedings initiated in mobbing cases, and establishment of working group comprised of practitioners to initiate amendments to the Law on Protection against Harassment in the Workplace. 

How is the commitment relevant to OGP values? COMMITMENT IS IMPORTANT FOR TRANSPARENCY because it provides access to new and more information, improves quality of information and access to public information, i.e. facilitates the right to information. COMMITMENT IS IMPORTANT FOR CIVIL PARTICIPATION because it creates opportunities and conditions for public participation and influence in decision-making, and increases opportunities for civil society involvement. COMMITMENT IS IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY because it enables establishment of mechanisms that will contribute to promotion of accountability of public officials. 

Additional information The commitment implies activities that will contribute to attainment of goals and actions defined by the Government of RNM after submission of the voluntary national review on implementation of SDGs at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in 2020. In particular, next step under SDG1: support for employment of vulnerable groups of people with measures anticipated under the National Strategy on Employment and Strategy for Formalization of Informal Economy, including operational plans for active employment programmes and measures and labour market services. Next step under SDG2: the government will focus on measures to improve the structure of agricultural lands as precondition for development and competitiveness in this sector, improve living and working conditions in rural areas and provide access to knowledge and investment in human capital through reformed services for expansion and education of farmers. Next step under SDG5: one of key priorities of the country in the next years will be continued efforts to improve employment opportunities for women and ensure their protection at work. Next step under SDG8: the government will monitor programmes and activities under relevant action plans for new jobs, improved participation in the labour market and increased labour demands increased competitiveness. Also, it will continue to align national labour legislation with international standards and EU acquis.

The new Law on Free Legal Aid (LFLA), whose implementation started in October 2019, has significantly improved access to justice for citizens. However, the law showcased certain weaknesses in the practice and needs to be amended in order to ensure efficient enforcement. One problem concerns forensic services that should be provided by the Bureau of Judicial Forensic. The problem identified concerns the Bureau’s inability to secure forensic expert in most common areas of legal problems for which citizens need free legal aid, including geodesy experts and DNA analysis (molecular biology). The second problem is related to (non)approval of applications for secondary legal aid in the case of victims of violent criminal offence in criminal proceedings. This is prompted by contradictory nature of transitional and final provisions under LFLA and limiting mechanisms under the Law on Criminal Proceedings (LCP). The third problem concerns the need for legal empowerment and legal education services under the human rights based approach. There are two dilemmas in respect to legal regulation of forensic expertise under the system of free legal aid. First, the Strategy on Justice System Reform 2017-2022 anticipates an activity for termination of the Bureau. This brings under question Art.13 (6) of LFLA. Second, the method, procedure and deadlines for provision of forensic findings and opinions by relevant body or forensic expert are not regulated in sufficient details. There is no back-up plan in case the Bureau is terminated. On the other hand, underway is development of Draft Law on Forensics, which keeps provisions related to operation of the Bureau. The uncertainty is identified in respect to current 100 regulations for coverage of forensic costs or addressing the lack of forensic experts in areas of legal problems faced by the vulnerable population. In terms of access to justice for victims of violent criminal offences, LFLA is contradictory as one provision explicitly stipulates that defence and court representation in criminal proceedings shall be secured pursuant to LCP (Art.38 of LFLA), while another provision still leaves in effect stipulations from the old law that anticipate legal aid in all court proceedings, in order to ensure protection for victims of criminal offences and victims of human trafficking (Art.49 of the new LFLA in relation to Art.8 of the old LFLA). Nevertheless, even if legal representation for victims of criminal offences is provided pursuant LCP, i.e. working version of the new LCP shows intent to find adequate solution, this does not eliminate the problem related to restricted mechanisms available to victims under LCP. Possibility for free legal aid is referred only in Art.53 (3) in correlation to Art.55 (1) (1) of LCP. This formulation is very rigid and stipulates that victims shall be entitled to legal counsellor on the burden of budget funds, i.e. free-of-charge meeting with counsellor or proxy prior to depositing his/her statement (provided they participate in proceedings as damaged party), i.e. statement or property tenure motion, provided they have suffered serious psycho-physical damages caused by the criminal offence and only if they are victim of criminal offence with threatened sanction of imprisonment sentence in duration of at least 4 years (low threshold for threatened sanction for this crime). Such formulation does not cover full representation during criminal proceedings, but reduces it to counselling during deposition of first statement. Leaving the victim of violent crime alone, without adequate representation during the court process just because LCP or LFLA does not allow such mechanism is contrary to all international standards and principles related to legal aid and legal services for victims. In addition to free legal aid as formally acknowledged form, there are also informal services that are most accessible to marginalized citizens because they are provided by civil society organizations, and by trained individuals from their communities.. Cooperation among different actors that work on legal empowerment and access to justice at local level remains very low. There is lack of specific joint action and mutual support, on the account of which implementation on the ground, which ultimately reflects access to justice, is left to the will of different entities without specific sustainable solutions in place. MoJ regional offices are not very visible and recognizable among citizens in physical terms. In many locations, due to cost-effectiveness, MoJ regional offices are accommodated at buildings with other institutions, are inadequately marked or not marked at all. Physical inaccessibility could mean difficult access to justice, dependence from other persons and discouragement to exercise the right to free legal aid. Persons with impaired sight and hearing are also non-informed about their right to free legal aid because there are no informational materials adjusted to their needs. MoJ’s website does not allow insight in the names of attorneys next in line to act upon application for free legal aid. Moreover, the website is not adjusted to persons with dyslexia and does not provide sufficient information in languages spoken by minority communities. There are no references where 101 and how citizens can lodge complaints about performance by authorised providers of free legal aid. According to the last research on legal needs of citizens from 2015, every second citizen in RNM is facing some legal problem. Worrying is the fact that citizens do not recognize their legal problems and qualify as legal problems only those that would end up before the court. It is evident that citizens in RNM need services and legal empowerment, but special attention should be paid to vulnerable groups which, due to their vulnerability, are in much more disadvantaged position and have limited access to justice. 

Main objective of the commitment Main objective: legal empowerment and access to justice for all citizens according to their legal needs and problems. Based on previously achieved milestones under NAP4 commitment, this new commitment ensures sustainability for access to justice and legal empowerment (taking into consideration recommendations from OGP Independent Reporting Mechanism to include the National Strategy on Legal Empowerment) by achieving several outcomes, as follows: - Creation of the National Strategy on Legal Empowerment; - Increased visibility and physical accessibility of MoJ regional offices; - Adoption of legal amendments aimed at more efficient exercise of access to justice and related to forensic expertise and access to legal aid for victims of violent crimes; - Establishment of cooperation between the Bureau of Judicial Forensic and forensic experts from all areas, and regulated procedure for provision of forensic findings and opinions; - Informed representatives from MoJ, the Bureau, Bar Association and other institutions providing forensic expertise in areas that affect access to justice for population of poor property status; - Publicly available information on forensic experts and providers of formal and informal legal services; - Merging data hosted on the websites https://pravnapomos.mk/ and https://www.pravnozajakni.mk/; - Mapping formal and informal providers of legal aid; - Creating and maintaining the publicly available registry of formal and informal legal aid providers; - Merging data disposed by CSOs and MoJ; - Establishment of interoperable and comprehensive database with information from all legal aid and legal service providers in order to assess the current state-of-affairs and find practical and reliable solutions; - Available services and information for persons with disabilities. 

How will the commitment contribute to addressing the public problem? The commitment concerns several interventions that will contribute to more efficient access to justice for all citizens. First, LFLA needs to be amended in order to provide basis for efficient access to forensic services in all areas for citizens and to guarantee efficient protection of victims of violent crimes. At the same time, in order to ensure forensic services pursuant to LFLA for legal issues that qualify for free legal aid, the Bureau of Judicial Forensic will sign contracts with forensic experts, followed by activities that will guarantee 102 involvement of all parties in the process. In order to provide efficient protection for victims of violent crimes, the gap in access to free legal aid in criminal proceedings for these victims necessitates relevant crime offences currently threatened with imprisonment sentence in smaller duration to be stipulated as crimes threatened with imprisonment sanction in duration of at least 4 years. Next is creation of the National Strategy on Legal Empowerment. The strategy will be created under transparent process with involvement of all relevant actors. The national strategy will be multi-sectoral and will include all stakeholder institutions and CSOs that work on provision of services, legal aid and legal empowerment. Moreover, it will anticipate specific activities, budget and timeline for legal empowerment of all citizens at national and local level. Comprehensive and sustainable approach is needed in order to merge activities of local institutions and CSOs into joint actions aimed at promoting access to justice for all. At the time of COVID-19 pandemic, efforts will be made to contribute to greater visibility, transparency and accessibility of formal and informal legal aid providers. Increased visibility and physical accessibility of MoJ regional offices will mean better availability of their services for citizens. Adjustment of relevant materials will result in timely information and empowerment of persons with disabilities. Accessibility of registries of legal aid providers will contribute to information and guidance of citizens where to address their legal needs according to the nature of their legal problem. The registry of forensic experts will contribute to greater openness of data and citizens’ right to choose. 

How is the commitment relevant to OGP values? COMMITMENT IS IMPORTANT FOR TRANSPARENCY because it provides access to new, more comprehensive and timely information related to exercise of the right to free legal aid and informal legal aid modalities and legal empowerment of citizens. It improves quality of information made available to citizens at national and local level, in exercise of their right to access to justice. It improves public availability of information and facilitates the right to information in respect to exercise of the right to access to justice by providing legal aid for citizens, especially for the most marginalized groups. COMMITMENT IS IMPORTANT FOR CIVIC PARTICIPATION because it creates and improves possibilities and conditions for public participation and impact in decision-making, thereby ensuring creation of activities that directly emerge from and are tailored to citizens’ needs, and active participation of citizens. It creates or improves the enabling environment for civil society by involving civil society organizations and citizens as active factors in development and promotion of access to justice, which will be formed into a complementary cycle of activities based on the needs of those for which they are intended. COMMITMENT IS IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY because it creates or improves accountability rules, regulations and mechanisms for public officials by creating and publishing publicly available information on implemented solutions on the basis of which all citizens, including the most marginalized groups, will be able to find adequate solution to their daily legal problems and hold the authorities accountable. 

Additional information • Required/secured budget by MoJ to implement part of the commitment. • Linked to the Law on Free Legal Aid, Strategy on Justice System Reform 2017-2022 • Linked to UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.3. RNM is indicated as model country committed to promote access to justice, including the priority area “access to justice” under OGP National Action Plan 2018-2020. Monitoring implementation of SDG 16.3 in the state necessitatesregular data collection and record keeping on the status of vulnerable groups of citizens These data should serve as baseline for development of national plan for implementation of SDG 16.3., i.e. plan for promotion of access to justice for vulnerable groups of citizens. Based on the analysis of previously collected data per defined indicator to monitor implementation of SDG 16.3 at national and local level, the plan for implementation of SDG 16.3. will be developed in the next period. In addition, one of the most frequent legal problems for which citizens need fee legal aid concerns geodesy studies. MYLA, with support from FOSM, developed policy brief on forensic expertise and free legal aid titled “Does the new Law on Free Legal Aid from 2019 facilitates access to free-of-charge forensic expertise to persons that were approved secondary legal aid?”. This policy document contains more information on the problem issue, but also recommendations and proposals to address the problem.

MK0193,North Macedonia,6,10,MKD,Europe,National,1,2024,2026,2,LEGAL EMPOWERMENT AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE,DIGITALIZATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE FREE LEGAL AID SYSTEM,Digitalization and Improvement of Legal Aid System,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

This commitment refers to the digitization and improvement of the free legal aid system (FLA) by upgrading and starting to put into practice the software for managing FLA cases, improving the system of collecting data and keeping statistics, ensuring interoperability for the exchange of data with other institutions included in the FLA system, as well as amendments to the Law on Free Legal Aid.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? 

The commitment for digitalization and improvement of the FLA system affects all citizens who, due to lack of financial resources, cannot exercise their rights and freedoms, and especially citizens who belong to the vulnerable categories. The absence of digitization, i.e. interoperable software for managing cases and collecting data affects the quality of the provided FLA, services, the duration of the procedure of collecting documents from the relevant institutions, the transparency and accountability of the Ministry of Justice and regional departments, which ultimately directly affects citizens' access to justice. In addition, with the entry into force of the new Law on Expertise, beneficiaries of the right to secondary legal aid lose their right to a free expert opinion and opinion that they are entitled to according to the Law on Free Legal Aid. Bearing this in mind, there is an urgent and immediate need to start a process for drafting amendments and supplements to the Law on Free Legal Aid in order to comply with the emerging situation with the adoption of the Law on Expertise. In addition to this issue, it is necessary to solve the problems related to several other areas for which the National Coordinating Body for Free Legal Aid has discussed on several occasions, and to overcome which amendments to the Law on Free Legal Aid are necessary (such as FLA for victims of crimes, FLA for victims of family and gender-based violence, exemption from ""other costs in the procedure"", etc., explained in more detail below). 

2. What are the causes of the problem? 

Ø Problems arising from the provisions in the Law on Free Legal Aid The need for an urgent and immediate need to start a process for making amendments and supplements to the Law on Free Legal Aid arises primarily from the newly created situation with the adoption of the Law on Expertise. With Article 62 of the Law on Expertise, the Bureau of Forensic Expertise was transformed into the Bureau of Assessment. From July 29th 2023, it no longer performs expert opinions, but only assessments. On the other hand, in accordance with Article 13 paragraph 6 of the Law on Free Legal Aid, expert opinions for the needs of persons who have been granted secondary legal aid are provided through the Bureau of Judicial Expertise in accordance with the Law on Expertise. Considering that the Bureau of Forensic Expertise as such no longer exists, users of secondary legal aid were left without access to the services of an expert. In practice, this gap can have particularly severe consequences in relation to persons, because expert reports are a particularly important means of evidence in civil proceedings, which according to Article 235 of the Law on Civil Procedure is usually submitted with the lawsuit or with the response to the lawsuit. What is necessary to arrange are: a) the entities that will be able to perform expertise in cases for which FLA has been approved; b) the method of selection of the subjects in an individual case, taking into account the rules of procedural laws; c) the procedure for making a skilled finding and opinion as well as giving a statement in the context of the FLA; and d) the procedure for payment of the award and expenses of the expert. In order to regulate these circumstances, it is necessary to amend the Law on Free Legal Aid, which should be carried out by a working group in which all stakeholders, including experts, will participate, regardless of how they will be organized thereat. In addition to the problem of expert evidence, particularly important issues that should be regulated by the amendments to the Law on Free Legal Aid are: - The absence of a clear and unequivocal right of FLA for the victims of crimes as damaged in the criminal procedure, which limits the possibility of the victims to protect and exercise their rights in the criminal procedure. This is contrary to EU law, in particular the Victims' Rights Directive; - Ensuring access to secondary legal assistance for victims of family and gender-based violence without determining property status; - The absence of provisions regulating the exemption from the so-called ""other costs in the procedure"" (eg. costs for a temporary representative, super expert evidence, inspection, etc.) which results in practice, although according to the law the beneficiaries are free of charge, they are still forced to pay them in order to continue the procedure. - Expansion of the legal issues for which a secondary procedure can be approved by including procedures that disproportionately affect poor people (eg. procedure for determining and collecting a debt before notaries i.e. executors, disputes regarding public and communal services, etc.); - Harmonize the approval terms and conditions for secondary legal aid with the standards established in the practice by the European Court of Human Rights; - Alignment of incomes that are not considered income with the new model of social protection established by the Law on Social Protection of 2019; - Deleting the engine displacement requirement and limiting the ownership of only one registered motor vehicle regardless of the vehicle's performance; - Beneficiaries of cash compensation from social assistance as a result of their financial situation when submitting a request for secondary legal assistance should not be subject to a financial inspection. Ø Lack of digitalization in the free legal aid system The process of developing software for managing FLA cases was started by the Ministry of Justice, but it is not functional and is not used in practice. The absence of such software makes it difficult to collect data, keep relevant statistics and plan policies. In addition, the absence of interoperability with other institutions complicates the process of the regional departments of the Ministry of Justice for obtaining data from other relevant authorities (such as the Center for Social Affairs, Public Revenue Office, Ministry of Interior, Cadastre, etc.), which significantly slows down and complicates the process of approving requests for secondary legal aid. 

Commitment Description

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? 

Ø In view of the required legal amendments The National Coordination Body for FLA (in which all stakeholders are members: MoJ and its regional departments, Bar Chamber, authorized associations and legal clinics) with the support of the European Council in 2022 identified problems in the Law on FLA arising from the practice of providers and prepared an Analysis on the need for amendments to the Law on FLA , which lists the key issues that the amendments should cover. The problem of expert evidences was discussed at the last 13-th meeting of the National Coordinating Body for FLA after the adoption of the new Law on Expert Evidence, which resulted in a recommendation for urgent and immediate amendments to the Law on Free legal Aid. A letter with the opinion of the National Coordinating Body for FLA was sent to the Minister of Justice and the State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice. Ø In view of digitalization of the FLA system As mentioned above, case management software for the FLA was developed by the Ministry of Justice, but it was never put into practice. Some trainings on the application of the software were conducted for employees in the regional departments of the MoJ, but without much success (partly due to the insufficient IT skills of the employees in the regional departments, and partly due to shortcomings in the software itself). 

2. What solution are you proposing? 

Ø In view of legal amendments It is necessary to urgently and immediately establish a working group by the Ministry of Justice for amendments and supplements to the Law on Free Legal Aid with the involvement of all stakeholders and a discussion of all identified shortcomings that cause problems in the use of these services by citizens. The Council of Europe and authorized citizens' associations and legal clinics should be involved in this process thereat. In view of the digitalization process It is necessary to identify the problems of the already existing FLA case management software of the Ministry of Justice and upgrade it, as well as trainings for the employees of the regional departments (both for the acquisition of basic IT skills and trainings for the use of the software itself). In addition, it is necessary to ensure the interoperability of the software with the software of other institutions and to ensure the access of the employees in the regional departments to the relevant data necessary for deciding on the requests for the provision of secondary legal aid. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? 

The problems faced by citizens when using FLA services, access to justice for all is strengthened, data collection, statistics management, transparency of FLA providers are removed with this commitment, policy making in this area are improved, the confidence of citizens in the institutions/organizations that provide FLA is strengthened and the number of people who benefit from FLA increases. 

Commitment Analysis 

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? 

Digitization in this area will significantly improve transparency in the management of FLA cases, the quality of annual reports and the possession of statistical data, which will significantly improve awareness among citizens. In addition, the proposed amendments to the legal solutions would improve the access to justice for the citizens, which would increase the range of users of these services, and thus the trust in the institutions. 

2. How will commitment help foster accountability? 

The digitization and revitalization of the FLA case management software will significantly help the tracking of cases and the preparation of reports, and thus the accountability of the Ministry of Justice and regional departments towards the citizens. In addition, this commitment is expected to support the accountability of the Ministry of Justice because it will launch an initiative to improve regulations, which in itself would mean bringing justice closer to citizens and especially to the poor population. 

3. How will commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? 

Associations of citizens registered for providing FLA as well as other relevant associations of citizens are actively involved in the work of the National Coordinating Body for FLA, from where the main proposals for amendments to the Law on FLA derive. It is expected that they will also be part of the working group for the preparation of the amendments to the Law, where the problems arising in practice for the citizens will be discussed jointly with all stakeholders.

The commitment aims to facilitate and increase public participation in decision-making in the area of the environment or that affect the environment.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? 

Transparency, access to information and public participation in decision-making related to the environment is a challenge that the state faces, and which is continuously stated by the European Commission in reports on the state's progress for 2020, 2021 and 2022. Challenges regarding public participation have also been identified by Macedonian NGOs. Public participation in the field of the environment occupies an important place in international law, so one of the pillars of the Aarhus Convention, ratified by North Macedonia in 1999, is precisely the obligation of public participation in decision-making, at least for processes and activities that the Convention itself stipulates. At the same time, the European Union acceded to the Aarhus Convention, and the EU itself, with its directives, foresees mandatory public participation in decisions and processes related to the environment. The public (citizens, NGOs, etc.), and especially the affected public (citizens who are currently and/or in the future may be affected or have an interest in making a decision about the environment and/or who are likely to feel the consequences of making the decision , including the civil organizations formed for the protection and improvement of the environment) face difficulties, and in certain cases, the denial of the right to participate in decision-making related to the environment. Taking into account the reports of the EC, this challenge has existed in the country for at least 4 years, and its persistence does not allow the public and the affected public to effectively get involved and influence decision-making in the field of the environment, in a way that would prevent or reduced negative impact on the environment. The commitment refers primarily to the importance of public participation in the procedures for the preparation and implementation of: 1) environmental protection reports and 2) water resources right permits. In a large part of the procedures related to granting a water resources right permit, an environmental protection report needs to be approved beforehand, so because of that, and in the direction of reforming the water management system and active involvement of the public in the whole process, the commitment it also focuses on the elaborations for environmental protection, as a previous part of granting the permission to use the waters or discharge into the waters. 

2. What are the causes of the problem? 

The reasons for public participation in the processes could be grouped into three groups: • Legal - The Law on the Environment in Article 24 does not stipulate 1) publication of reports on environmental protection, 2) possibility and deadlines for public participation by submitting written comments and observations, 3) obligation to take opinions from the public during the approval of the reports, 4) legal protection for the public and the affected public. The issue has been elaborated in analyses by Macedonian NGOs. At the same time, although the Law on Watter Supplies stipulates that the content of the publication of the application for a water supplies right permit in a daily newspaper and on the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is defined by a by-law, which , has not yet been adopted , and the publication is based on the practice of the Water Supply Sector in the Environment Administration within the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning. The last request for a water right permit is from 2016, when the request was not published, only the accompanying letter that the requester submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning. • Technical - there is no central place in the country where all documents and notices are published to which the public has the right to submit comments and opinions. Such documents are published in various places on the website of the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning and on portals developed by the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning. So, for example: 1) information on submitted applications for permits for water rights is published on the section of the website of the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning intended for the Water Supply Sector in the ""Publications"" section; 2) information related to environmental impact assessment is published in the ""Services"" section, subsection ""Environmental Impact Assessment Studies"" on the website of the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning; 3) information related to integrated environmental permits is published in the section ""Services"" subsection ""Integrated pollution prevention and control-ISKZ"" on the website of the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning and at the same time on the REGISTER portal, and separate information is also published on the REGISTER OF SUPERVISED SUBJECTS AND INSPECTION REPORTS of the State Environmental Inspectorate. Given that public participation is bound by deadlines, on all these portals there is no automatic generation of dates when the document is published, so a challenge may arise in terms of considering the deadlines for submitting comments, and then in terms of deadlines for legal protection, where it is foreseen. • Personnel – Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning is faced with a lack of employees for the efficient implementation of all the numerous competences it has.

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? 

What has been done so far is that most of the documents in the Water Supply Sector have been adopted, but they are not properly systematized and are not publicly available so that citizens can have access to them and get involved in the consultation process at any time. Such announcements are not made, perhaps because they are not mandatory according to the Law on the Environment (Article 24), but within the framework of increasing transparency, openness and accountability for what has been done, it is very necessary to do so and in this way all previously adopted decisions and documentation to be successful also in the part of satisfying the criteria for OGP. 

2. What solution are you proposing? 

1. Improving the availability and information related to the water registers that are prepared and edited on the website of the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning according to the following principle: - Possibility to comment on documents that have already been uploaded to the website; - Publication of all documents related to the subject o For ex. When the Water Department has to publish a request for obtaining a permit, the software itself will provide a field in which the entire request form should be attached, a field in which the solution for the approved environmental protection report or the impact assessment study should be attached on the environment etc. It will be mandatory to filled with files, before proceeding to the next stage of publishing the information on the portal. The implementation of these activities will 1) provide prerequisites for public participation in all decision-making procedures related to the use of water supplies, 2) will facilitate public access to information that will lead to effective public involvement in the decision-making process and opportunity for substantial impact on water management. Hence, the implementation of these activities is expected to fully solve the legal and technical problems identified above, but it will also contribute to the consistent implementation of Macedonian environmental legislation, as well as the fulfillment of the objective of international documents for public participation in decisions, related to the environment in the area of water law. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? 

The improvement of the existing registers of the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning in the area of water law, that will stipulate a mandatory publication of specific documents from certain processes, before moving to the next stage of the procedure regulated by law, will contribute to the full implementation of the Macedonian legislation and will affect the change of the remarks by the European Commission regarding the participation of the public in the processes related to environment. The obligation of the employees of Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning to first publish all documents on the platform before proceeding with the next phase of the legal procedure will contribute to changing possible negative practices. On the other hand, the public and the affected public will have easier access to inclusion in the decision-making related to water management, and the established platform in the manner described earlier will also serve as a roadmap for their successful participation in the processes. Having access to all documents necessary for effective involvement in decision-making will increase public influence and participation in environmental protection. In that way, the knowledge, skills and capacities of the public and the affected public in making decisions related to the environment will be strengthened, through digitalization and the application of ICT tools. 

Commitment Analysis 

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? 

Implementation of the commitment will make it possible to directly increase the transparency of the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning by making all documents that are of interest to the public available in one place and organized, and every citizen who is interested will be able to read them and submit their own comments or observations. 

2. How will commitment help foster accountability? 

The publication of documents of interest to citizens on the website of the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning will greatly influence the increase of institutions responsibility, both for consultations with citizens and in the area of implementing legal accountability or obligations arising from strategic documents. 

3. How will commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? How will citizens and Civil groups be proactively involved? 

The process of availability and opportunities to review the processes and documents will provide possibility to actively involve citizens in the public consultation processes, citizens will have the opportunity to be informed in a timely manner and to react where necessary, and through the strategic processes, again, they will have the opportunity to be directly involved in the implementation of measures and activities, but also to monitor the implementation.

The Assembly is a legislative government in the system of organization of state power in the country and the sovereign representative of the will of the citizens. In the Decisions of openness and transparency of the legislative authority, the Assembly has been a part of the Open Government Partnership since 2018, with a special working group, a special Action Plan with commitments to the OGP and approaches to external monitoring of the implementation of the planned activities. Apart from this, in the capacity of its legislative function, the Assembly supports all legal solutions that other governments, executive and judicial, propose for the realization of their OGP commitments. Finally, the Assembly also has a supervisory function, and in this sense it is interested in fully monitoring the implementation of the national OGP plan 2024-2026. That is why the Action Plan 2024-2026 projects holding a supervisory meeting in the appropriate working body.

Defining a problem 

1. What problem does the commitment address? 

The commitment should stimulate the exercise of the supervisory role of the parliaments, even in relation to the implementation of the OGP. According to the Memorandum on Parliamentary Engagement by the OGP, it is recommended that parliaments, apart for themselves, should also be involved in monitoring what other governments are implementing. Considering that it is a matter of programming the fifth cycle of the Action Plan towards the OGP, the Assembly, as a legislative government in its constitutional capacity to supervise the bodies of the executive authority, has not conducted a supervisory hearing until now. The National OGP Plan is an executive government document proposed by the MIOA (Ministry of Information Society and Administration) and adopted by the Government. The Assembly is affected by this commitment, because it signifies the exercise of constitutional competences of the legislative government. Others affected are all bodies from the executive and judicial governments that propose measures in the national OGP plan.

2. What are the reasons for the problem? 

The implementation of the supervisory discussion should give a report and inform the deputies about the implementation of the activities from the national OGP plan. In addition, the programming of such a commitment itself gives predictability to the supervisory discussions in the Assembly. Namely, the legislator in the Law on the Assembly has already provided that at the coordination institute, the coordinators of the political parties with the President of the Assembly make an annual plan of supervisory discussions in the Assembly. 

Description of the commitment 

1. What has been done so far for the problem to be solved? 

The Assembly, considering the fact that it is included in the OGP through its own Action Plan, within the process of co-creation of the document, is involved at the level of a working group of MPs, representatives of parliamentary political parties, employees of the Assembly's service, international and domestic civil society partner organizations. Furthermore, in relation to specific commitments, there are also working subgroups. So, as far as its own Action Plan is concerned, the Assembly is familiar with it and is implementing it. The MPs were partially informed about the principles and the nature of the OGP within the framework of various events for the promotion of activities and the partnership. The working group is informed only about the Action Plan of the Assembly, so the Coordinators or the MPs are not familiar with the commitments of other governments and bodies. 

2. What solution are you proposing? 

The commitment projects the organization of a supervisory discussion in one of the working bodies, with all the steps provided for in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly. The supervisory discussion will provide information for the MPs about what the country is doing in relation to the national OGP plan, but in the form of presentations as well, witnesses will be able to learn about the problems, the degree of implementation, leaders in implementation, etc. 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? 

The result of this commitment is direct and indirect. Direct results are the involvement of the legislative government in its supervisory capacity. Informing MPs about OGP. Indirect results are the predictability of the use of the Supervisory Discussion Institute in the Assembly in relation to other topics and policies. 

Analysis of the commitment 

1.How will the commitment promote transparency? 

In the implementation of the commitment, the supervisory discussion is open to the public. Additionally, it will be broadcast on the Assembly TV channel. The media will also have the opportunity to attend directly. The public opening of the implementation of the policies makes the Parliament engaged in monitoring the work of the executive and judicial governments in the area of implementation of the OGP. 

2.How will the commitment help to encourage responsibility? 

The presence of the public at the supervisory discussion causes greater interest among the MPs as well. Informing MPs by informing the public and citizens can get to know with what is going on directly and from the source.

operates in, rather than a single set of information at a global level. Reporting, for

Increasing Public Integrity,Measures in foreign and development policy to promote freedom of expression and independent media,Promote Freedom of Expression and Independent Media,"Status quo or problem/issue to be addressed: Information is an integral part of freedom of expression. Information is crucial for people to be able to make informed decisions about their own lives, and so that they are able to understand and exercise their rights. Freedom of expression is under pressure from both state and non-state actors. Some trends: Increase in the number of attacks against individuals who express themselves, e.g. journalists, bloggers and artists. Legislation is abused to prevent criticism and silence dissent. Public access to information is restricted. Internet censorship, filtering, blocking and monitoring. Increasing self-censorship. Concentration of ownership in media limits diversity. In September 2015, the UN member states adopted the new sustainable development goals (SDGs). Goal 16.10 deals with access to information and protection of fundamental freedoms. Access to information is one of three theme areas in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' new strategy on freedom of expression. Main Objectives The Ministry of Foreign Affairs shall - initiate the development of international standards for the right to information, - contribute to the development of and compliance with legislation at the national level concerning the right to access information, advocate for more transparency and better access to information in the United Nations system and in other international organizations.

NO0063,Norway,4,10,NOR,Europe,National,1,2019,2022,3,Open data and reuse of public data,Openness on artificial intelligence and algorithms,Openness on Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms,"What problem for the general public does the commitment address? In the future, the public sector will use artificial intelligence to deliver more targeted and user-adapted services, enhance the social benefit of its own activities, rationalise operations and work processes, and reduce risk. 

What is the commitment? a. Develop guidance on responsible use of artificial intelligence in the public administration. b. Establish a regulatory sandbox for data protection under the Data Protection Authority to improve the entities’ understanding of the regulatory requirements for data protection and reduce the time from development and testing to roll-out of AI solutions in the market. c. Stipulate that new solutions in the public administration that use artificial intelligence must be transparent and verifiable. d. Amend the Public Administration Act and other relevant regulations to also cover use of automated case processing and artificial intelligence. Develop an analytical platform that can provide better opportunities for analysis of data from Norwegian health registers, whilst still ensuring protection of personal data. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the problem? The use of artificial intelligence in public administration may seem demanding, especially if the organisation does not have adequate in-house expertise. Agencies may be reticent to start using AI systems due to inadequate knowledge among caseworkers about the regulatory frameworks and how to handle personal data, coordination with the Public Administration Act, and assessing when it is acceptable to use artificial intelligence. This can undermine the public sector’s ability to improve its services or rationalise its case processing. Guidance on responsible use of artificial intelligence will make public agencies aware of ethical dilemmas; for example, linked to when it is right and reasonable to use artificial intelligence for verification purposes. The process can be made transparent and verifiable through the development of regulations; for example, by amending the Public Administration Act, which regulates case processing in the public sector, including automated case processing, ensuring compliance with important public administration principles such as data protection and rule of law A regulatory sandbox on artificial intelligence and data protection will provide both public and private organisations with an understanding of the regulatory requirements that apply in respect of data protection, and provide the authorities with greater understanding of new technological solutions and the risks associated with them. Society will benefit from the responsible development of new and innovative solutions. 

How is this commitment relevant to the OGP’s fundamental values? Guidance on and regulation of the use of artificial intelligence in the public sector shall ensure transparency in public solutions and decision-making processes that use artificial intelligence. The work on guidance and development of regulations builds on practice and guidelines that ensure the involvement of relevant stakeholders and the general public throughout the entire process.

The specific legislation ""Access to Information Act"" will enable greater participation of citizens in the management of public affairs. This will be done in reference to any other policy proposals by government.; Brief Description of Commitment: Pursuant to s 51 (1) of the Constitution it states ""Every citizen has the right of reasonable access to official documents subject only to the need for such secrecy as is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society"". Further in s 51 (3), it states ""Provision shall be made by law to establish procedures by which citizens may obtain ready access to official information"".

As a cornerstone for open government policies, ATI legislation is one of the four main eligibility criteria for joining the OGP while the others Fiscal Transparency, Income and Asset Disclosures, and Public Participation. Any country wishing to participate in OGP needs to meet minimum eligibility requirements. For most countries, this includes having in place an ATI law and this directly aligns with our Commitment to the ATI legislation.; Ambition - Briefly describe the intended results of the commitment and how it will either make government open or improve government through more openness: Since 2011, countries in five continents have included more than 120 ATI commitments in their National Action Plans (NAPs), spanning from legal reforms and capacity building activities to technological developments and dissemination programs. The ATI is expected to be a key instrument contributing towards transparency and accountability to build more open institutions, and generating useful public knowledge.

In 2013, a National Executive Council (NEC) Decision endorsed the implementation of the EITI in PNG. PNG published so far published four reports covering financial years 2013, 2014, 2015 & 2016. The first report (2013) highlighted certain key challenges including the unavailability of relevant extractive sector management data for public to access. One of the challenges was the absence of enabling legislation to compel reporting entities to provide timely and accurate data.; Main objective: By March 2019, PNG to have a national policy vehicle and an enabling legislation on EITI; Legal Establishment of an EITI Statutory Authority; Brief description of commitment: At the policy level, the Government, through a NEC decision endorsed key recommendations of the 2013 Report. There were a total of 11 NEC directives relating to improving Government reporting entities to either participate fully in the EITI process and to beef up reporting systems and processes for greater accountability and transparency. Despite this a major challenges remain surrounding its implementation. By introducing the EITI policy and legal framework, PNG will meet its OGP commitments by fostering an enabling environment for civic participation, open and transparent government and a more accountable extractive sector.; OPG challenge addressed by the commitment: OGP challenges this commitment attempts to address include: •	Lack of transparency in the extractive industry payments (taxes, royalties) from both government and developers. • Lack of civil society voice in the extractive sector • Lack of contract transparency. • Lack of accountability and public participation • Lack of access to data • As a result of this commitment, the reporting entities will be more compliant and citizens will be better informed of how the extractive sector is managed in the country.; Relevance: Relevance commitment describe the way in which this is relevant to further advancing OGP values of access to information, public accountability, civic participation, and technology and innovation for openness and accountability.

PNG0012,Papua New Guinea,2,5,PNG,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2022,2024,2,Government Integrity,Timely production and publication of Annual Audit Reports,Publication of Annual Audit Reports,"Problem/Issue to be addressed The Office of the Auditor General produces four Annual Reports and the reports are based on the timely release of the Financial Statements from State Agencies including Statutory Authorities and State-Owned Enterprises. However, for the last couple of years, those reports have not been produced as required by the Audit Act. The agencies delayed in submitting their financial statements on time. The public fund appropriated to the agencies and used are not reported, published and event tabled on the Parliament through the Parliament Audit Committee.

Main Objective The financial auditing of state agencies including statutory authorities and state-owned enterprises is to ensure that the agencies are accountable to their citizens in the use of public funds. It is also to minimise the misuse of public funds and promote transparency and accountability in the government institutions and state-owned enterprises.

Brief Description of Commitment The commitment basically focuses on the public finance and expenditure report on the fund’s allocation for service delivery in national and sub-national levels and the state-owned enterprises. It is a mechanism in which the Auditor General keeps accountable on the funds being used for both operational and capital investment. OGP through this commitment will facilitate the timely release of the financial statements from departments, statutorily authorities, subnational governments, and state-owned enterprises. The Office of the Auditor General will then use the financial statements to produce four (4) reports; hence reports for: departments, subnational government, statutory authorities, and state-owned enterprises. Through the Commitment will enable the Parliament Accounts Committee to work through which the audit reports will be made available in the Parliament.

OGP Challenge address by the Commitment Government departments/agencies and other subsidiary bodies have not been submitting timely financial statements to the Department of Finance to then submit to the Office of the Auditor General for audit and presentation to Parliament, thus resulting in PNG’s annual audit reports not being made available to the public in a timely manner. Make fiscal data available in an accurate and timely manner so that the citizens and the stakeholder of this country will have to know how money is coming in and how money is going out of the country. This includes having timely annual audit reports made public aware on the AGO website and other gov’t websites (such as Treasury, who publish the in-year reports).

Relevance Briefly describe the way in which this commitment is relevant to further advancing OGP values of access to information, public accountability, civic participation and technology and innovation for openness and accountability. The financial auditing is done in order to know how public funds are managed at the national and sub national levels and the government make better analysis on the next budget for effective service delivery. It is equally important to maintain PNG’s eligibility as a member of the OGP to enable PNG to exercise a leadership role in governance issues in the region.

Ambition Briefly described the intended results of the commitment and how it will either make government more open or improve government through more openness The financial auditing of the use of public funds is an important element of promoting transparency and accountability in the government process. The annual financial auditing and publication of those audit reports will enable agencies that receives public funds to improve on the use of public funds, hence improve accountability.

PNG0013,Papua New Guinea,2,6,PNG,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2022,2024,2,Freedom of Information,Access to Information Legislation,Access to Information Legislation,"Problem/Issue to be addressed The flow of information for public consumption and decision-making is weak in PNG. The agencies within the government, civil society and private sectors are overprotective in sharing information for public benefit due to administrative restrictions. There is no policy or legislation platform that enables the agencies (government, CSO & private sectors) to share public information that are required by organizations and individuals planning and decision-making purposes, for evidence-based policy formulation, investments and general public consumption.

Main Objective The objective of this commitment is to enhance the flow of public information through a legislative framework to enable greater participation of citizens in the management of public affairs. The Access to Information Legislation will address the barriers that limit the flow of information to the citizens and from one agency to another agency or from point A to point B.

Brief Description of Commitment Pursuant to s 51 (1) of the National Constitution, it states that “every citizen has the right of reasonable access to official documents subject only to the need for such secrecy as is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society”. Further in s 51 (3), it states “provision shall be made by law to establish procedures by which citizens may obtain ready access to official information”. The current Access to Information Act will allow citizens to have access to government information. The National Constitution calls for an appropriate legislation to be developed to enable easy accessibility of public information. The Access to Information Legislation will be drafted to be enacted by Parliament to address the flow of information barriers faced in the country.

OGP Challenge address by the Commitment OGP Grand Challenge to be addressed through this Commitment are; ✓ Ease the administrative barriers of the flow of public information. ✓ Establish the legislative framework that will obligate agencies to make available public information for access. ✓ Enable citizens to have access to valuable public information that they have wished to but never accessed before. ✓ Increasing Public Integrity and confidence in the Government Information Systems.

Relevance Briefly describe the way in which this commitment is relevant to further advancing OGP values of access to information, public accountability, civic participation and technology and innovation for openness and accountability. “Access to information legislation” is one of the central tenets of the OGP and has become a major driving force in the promotion of access to information reforms worldwide. As a cornerstone for open government platform, the legal right to request information from the government can lead to more open, accountable, and participatory government while the public are required to have laws enabling the fair access to information and could further establish mechanisms through which they can monitor and provide feedback on the right to information system. Any country wishing to participate in OGP needs to meet minimum eligibility requirements, hence access to information directly aligns with PNG Commitment to the OGP membership. This commitment to enact the “Access to Information” legislation and other proposed bills are expected to be key instruments contributing towards transparency and accountability to build more open institutions, and generate useful public knowledge. Furthermore, there are valuable tools to allow for greater engagement of citizens in the management of public affairs.

Ambition Briefly described the intended results of the commitment and how it will either make government more open or improve government through more openness Since 2011, countries in five continents have included more than 120 access to information commitments in their National Action Plans (NAPs), spanning from legal reforms and capacity building activities to technological developments and dissemination programs. The Access to Information Legislation is expected to be a key instrument contributing towards transparency and accountability to build more open institutions, and generating useful public knowledge. Furthermore, it is a valuable tool to allow for greater engagement of citizens in the management of public affairs.

OGP Challenge address by the Commitment The cluster commitment enables constructive engagement between government and civil society on issues of legislative openness and citizens participation in the legislative process through e-government processes.

Relevance Briefly describe the way in which this commitment is relevant to further advancing OGP values of access to information, public accountability, civic participation and technology and innovation for openness and accountability. E-government legislation is the enabler to digitizing government electronic information for accessibility in civic space, accountability for transparency and to harness technology and innovation.

""Problem/Issue to be addressed This new technology cluster has a number of issues to be addressed due to our slow advancement in the E-government reforms. These issues include the adaptation of a rapidly evolving international, economic, social, technological and cultural environment. The issue of protecting and advancing democracy, strengthening social and economic development, ensuring environmental sustainability and managing technological challenges in new ways to earn the public's trust.

Main Objective E-Government Policy enables digital government services to transform into an inclusive digital society where all citizens can benefit from the opportunities offered by digital technologies to improve quality of life. The e-Government Policy establishes a policy platform in which a number of legislations, strategies and programs will be derived to enhance the digital transformation system in the country. It also optimizes service delivery that provides universal access to government information and services anytime and anywhere.

Brief Description of Commitment The Commitment focuses on the formulation of the e-Government Policy to establish a policy platform to enhance digital transformation. This commitment is the use of technological communications devices, such as computers and internet, to provide public services to citizens. E-government Policy offers new opportunities for more direct and convenient citizen access to government, and for government provision of services directly to citizens. The Digital interaction between a citizen and the government, between governments and other government agencies, between government and citizens, between government and employees and between government and businesses.

OGP Challenge address by the Commitment The commitment addresses significant challenges of the government in relation to information dissemination, lack of accountability and transparency, bureaucracy and lack of citizen participation in domestic institutions and processes. Moreover, lack of stakeholder involvement, coordination, information sharing, ICT literacy and e-Government awareness are considered to be the major obstacle. The policy presents an opportunity to the ICT Sector for a major transformation in the digital space.

Relevance Briefly describe the way in which this commitment is relevant to further advancing OGP values of access to information, public accountability, civic participation and technology and innovation for openness and accountability. The technological development has turned the government policies and strategies towards e-government. The e-government is considered the primary tool to facilitate the access of the citizen to various services thus the government plans and subsidies shall reach the public through e-government portal.Furthermore, the e-government policy gives easy access to government information and development agendas, keeps accountable when information is readily available and accessible. It encourages more civic participation as technology harnesses information on the government budget and expenditure report.

Ambition Briefly described the intended results of the commitment and how it will either make government more open or improve government through more openness The intended result of the commitment is to improve transparency in the government system and processes. E-government minimizes redundant information flow, helps to eliminate duplication of functions and improves the adherence of public servants to proper government procedures, thereby reducing opportunities for corruption. The E-government has made information from legislative meeting minutes to budget proposals to map-based information available to the public. It also implies that public processes are becoming more transparent, public information is available online and citizens and non-government organizations are encouraged to interact with public administration through new platform-based forms of participation and collaboration.

The successive Governments have failed to improve the Budget Expenditure Reporting in the country. There is a fragmented reporting system. There is no legislation that empowers the agencies such as Departments of National Planning and Monitoring and Treasury to legally demand the agencies to report on their expenditures. The financial expenditures have not been disclosed for public access and the political leaders and the head of agencies were not held accountable. The monetary value of goods and services have not reflected the monetary value. The agencies that receive capital investment budget failed to report on their spending. Even though there are suspicious of misuse but there is lack of comprehensive investigations.

Main Objective The objective of the Commitment is to improve transparency and accountability in the budget implementation and reporting processes. This is to making sure leaders being accountable to the citizens. The discloser of expenditure report is important to ensure there is correspondence between the money budgeted and spent in that budgeted item.

Brief Description of Commitment This commitment will enable the Department of National Planning and Monitoring and the Department of Treasury to monitor the implementation of the Budget (both capital and operational) and report to the citizen through the National Parliament and publication through media outlet annually. This will be enabled by the enactment of the Planning and Monitoring Responsibility Act which calls for all state agencies to report on the implementation of their respective programs and the projects. Those reports will be consolidated and published annually through media outlets.

OGP Challenge address by the Commitment The compulsory expenditure reporting will enable agencies to:
• Improve weakness in budget expenditure reporting mechanisms
• Make leaders and head of agencies accountable to the citizens
• Improve service delivery
• Improve weakness in the Governance process
• Promote performance-based budgeting
• Ensuring value for money is reflected on the ground

Relevance Briefly describe the way in which this commitment is relevant to further advancing OGP values of access to information, public accountability, civic participation and technology and innovation for openness and accountability. The commitment will enhance the agencies’ capacities to accurately and timely report on the budget implementation. The reported expenditure reports will then be published after tabling on the Floor of the National Parliament. This process promotes Good Governance, Accountability, transparency, Government integrity and making Government responsive to citizens’ needs which are the objectives of the OGP.

Ambition Briefly described the intended results of the commitment and how it will either make government more open or improve government through more openness This commitment aims to promote monitoring and reporting on the budget expenditure that makes Government accountable and build investor confidence. This commitment will lead to improving financial management practices within Government departments/agencies.

In 2013, the National Executive Council (NEC) endorsed the implementation of the EITI in PNG. Since then, PNG has produced seven (2014-2020) consecutive annual reports. The report in each year has its own recommendations which were considered when formulating the following years report. The administrative issues and other crucial issues surrounding data are being addressed through endorsement of the EITI Policy and the legislations will be pursued soon.

OGP Grand Issues and Challenges the Commitment will address Whilst PNG has successfully completed its seven EITI Report since 2013, major challenges remain surrounding administration.

 ¿Cómo contribuirá a resolver la problemática?
 Ante la falta del acto administrativo por excelencia del Poder Ejecutivo el Decreto, el manual solo es implementado por algunas Instituciones; con un decreto toda la órbita del Poder Ejecutivo estaría implementando el Manual, la información de todas las instituciones llegaría al ciudadano en un formato amigable y comprensible, y se darían las condiciones para que el ciudadano pueda participar en el control de la gestión pública.
 
 ¿Por qué es relevante a los valores de OGP?
 Contar con un Decreto por el cual se implementa el Manual de Rendición de cuentas en las institucionales permitirá visibilizar por parte del ciudadano el aporte de cada institución al desarrollo económico y social del país, facilitando el escrutinio público de las decisiones que se realizan en el sector público. Este compromiso es de gran relevancia considerando que la mayor demanda en el sector público se encuentra en la órbita del Poder Ejecutivo.

PY0071,Paraguay,5,2.1,PRY,Americas,National,1,2022,2024,2,NA,Presentation of the organic law creating SENIT,Creating the National Secretariat for Integrity and Transparency (SENIT),"Brief description of the commitment: Submit a bill ""Creating the National Secretariat for Integrity and Transparency (SENIT)"" to the National Congress. 

What is the problem that the engagement seeks to address? The National Anticorruption Secretariat (SENAC) was created by Executive Decree No. 10,144 of 2012, which was followed by another amending Decree that expanded the powers of this Secretariat. According to the decrees, it is an institution under the Presidency of the Republic of Paraguay, responsible for developing, promoting and implementing public policies on transparency, integrity and anti-corruption, whose scope of application are those State Agencies and Entities (OEE) under the Executive Branch, as well as those institutions outside the Executive Branch that have signed an agreement with SENAC. Likewise, SENAC is entrusted with coordinating and articulating all these measures with all sectors of society, in the understanding that the fight against corruption is approached in a systemic manner. The lack of a legal norm creating SENAC and containing its powers and attributions generates a lack of involvement of the other OEEs and other sectors of society that are relevant in the fight against corruption to achieve better and sustainable results. 

What is the commitment? To present the bill that will have as its main purpose that the National Secretariat for Integrity and Transparency (SENIT) replaces the National Anticorruption Secretariat (SENAC) as the guiding institution responsible for elaborating, promoting and implementing public policies of transparency, integrity and the fight against corruption in the agencies of the Executive Branch, the central administration of the State, the entities of the decentralized public administration, public companies and joint ventures, and to corporations in which the State is a majority shareholder. The patrimony, assets, and financial resources, as well as the personnel of SENAC will belong to SENIT. 

How will you contribute to solving the problem? The projected regulations contemplate all the powers and functions in the fight against corruption, whether for prevention or management of complaints, the use of digital tools, as well as the need to coordinate policies with other government agencies and entities and the power to enter into cooperation agreements. 

Why is it relevant to OGP values? Accountability is part of one of the schemes already addressed by SENAC within the framework of the fight against corruption and as a mechanism for citizen participation par excellence. The bill establishes the following roles and powers of SENIT: Promote awareness and citizen participation actions. Promote prevention and compliance actions in the private sector.

PY0072,Paraguay,5,2.2000000000000002,PRY,Americas,National,1,2022,2024,2,NA,Preparation of the preliminary draft of the Law regulating lobbying activities (Lobby Law),Draft Law for Lobbying Regulation,"Brief description of the commitment: Following the international recommendations regarding the alignment to legal standards related to the regulation of public integrity indicated in the National Integrity, Transparency and Anticorruption Plan (PNI 2021-2025), the need to work on the drafting of a bill to regulate lobbying activities was identified, for its official presentation to the Executive Branch. 

What is the problem that the engagement seeks to address? According to the International Standards for Lobbying Regulation report, the purpose of lobbying regulations is to ensure that there is transparency about the impact of lobbying on decision-making processes, as well as accountability for the policies and laws that are adopted. Lobbying regulation should seek to create a more level playing field, allowing all actors to participate in the decision-making process on an equal footing, and specific mechanisms need to be in place to prevent potential conflicts of interest from influencing the decision-making process. It is also important to note that regulation is only one of the elements that a strategy to ensure fairlobbying must include: compliance with any regulation, but also the willingness of all actors involved to behave ethically, will be crucial to foster an environment where lobbying and decisions on public affairs are carried out ethically and fairly. Lobbying is a legitimate activity and an important aspect of the democratic process. There is a significant public interest in ensuring the transparency and integrity of lobbying, as well as diversity in participation and contribution to decision-making processes on public issues. The standard is a pending matter for the Republic of Paraguay, which requires, in accordance with the vision of the National Integrity, Transparency and Anti-Corruption Plan (PNI 2021- 2025), the implementation of a regulatory framework that covers this dimension within the framework of the promotion of public ethics in the country. 

What is the Commitment? Draft bill regulating lobbying activities, for its official presentation to the Executive Branch. 

How will you contribute to solving the problem? The proposal consists of drafting a bill to address the lack of regulation of lobbying activities in Paraguay, to promote compliance with the systemic anti-corruption agenda established in the National Integrity, Transparency and Anti-Corruption Plan, Axis 4 Framework for the Control of Public Procurement and the Internal Control and Risk Systems, Objective 4.7. Regulation of conflicts of interest and lobbying activities, Action 4.7.3. 

Why is it relevant to OGP values? The regulation aims precisely at defining principles, concepts and procedures that make the management of lobbying in Paraguay transparent. The exercise of accountability is the central goal of the proposed regulation, with the incorporation of procedures and records of public access, which guarantees citizen control of the management of state employees in this area. The incorporation of clear rules will allow public servants to be governed by them and to document their activities to report them. The incorporation of a regulation on lobbying will allow citizens to have direct access to the management of authorities and public servants in relation to lobbying activities carried out by interest groups with these actors, which will allow greater control by citizens as a way of safeguarding the public interest.

However, 29 years since the first Freedom of Information (FOI) bill was filed, the Philippine Congress has yet to pass a legislation that promotes access to information.; What is the commitment?: Passage of a Freedom of Information Law; How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem?: To have Congress pass legislation on access to information which will mandate the disclosure of government information, from all three branches to the general public. Passage of the FOI Law will ensure that government efforts on transparency will become the norm and will institutionalize disclosure of government-held information. Also, enacting an FOI law shall not only foster a culture of transparency but shall empower citizen to hold government accountable by monitoring the use of public funds and the delivery of public services.; Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?: The passage of a Freedom of Information Law is crucial for Filipino citizens to exercise their right to access governmentheld information. It empowers citizen participation in demanding for transparency and accountability from the government. The Law will mandate all branches of the government to disclose all documents as well as the procedures for accessing these documents. Transparency- all government agencies shall be mandated to proactively access or provide access to information of public concern, unless such is proven to fall within limited and strictly construed exceptions. Accountability- all government agencies shall be made to comply with uniform standards on the disclosure of public information. Furthermore, enactment of an FOI law will empower citizen participation in holding governments accountable to its people.; Additional information: Here are some developments in the FOI program: • On June 2016, House Bill 334 entitled “An Act to Ensure Public Access to Official Records, Documents and any other Information of Public Concern was filed in the House of Representatives for the 17th Congress. • On July 2016, President Duterte signed Executive Order No. 2 entitled “Operationalizing in the Executive Branch the People’s Constitutional Right to Information and the State Policies of Full Public Disclosure and Transparency in the Public Service and Providing Guidelines Therefor”. • On October 2016, the Senate Committee on Public Information and Mass Media submitted Senate Bill 1208 or the People’s Freedom of Information Act which consolidates 14 bills filed by senators.

PH0067,Philippines,6,1,PHL,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2023,2027,4,NA,Freedom of Information Program,Scaling Up Implementation of Freedom of Information Program,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

The commitment aims to rebuild and scale-up the momentum of the implementation of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Program by intensifying the localization and adoption of the FOI Program across local governments in the Philippines and institutionalizing and digitalizing the citizen’s access to public information across branches of government and non-government sectors.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? The fight for the passage of the FOI Law in the Philippines has already been more than 3-decades long, but to no avail, the FOI Bill remains pending in Congress. Similarly, the FOI Program had gone through three (3) NAP cycles as a commitment. While substantial results and achievements were unlocked in the course of the implementation, having the FOI Bill passed into law remains unsuccessful. Despite and amidst these abject turn of events in the access to information landscape, the Freedom of Information-Program Management (FOI-PMO), under the Presidential Communications Office (PCO), persists in recalibrating strategies to ensure that the FOI Practice thrives and advances in the Philippine bureaucracy. Elevating the FOI Program implementation under the 6th NAP Cycle, this commitment addresses the bureaucratic inertia and plateau of both local and national FOI movement in the country by rebuilding on the already-established undertakings of the FOI Program, and scaling up on the momentum of the implementation of the localized FOI Program under the new administration. Within this ambit, the commitment carries on the goal of streamlining platforms for access to government information from various government agencies and offices for a proactive, reactive, timely, relevant, and accurate disclosure of information to the public and intensifying engagements with local government units (LGUs) for the localization and adoption of the FOI Program nationwide. Despite the issuance of the Duterte Administration of Executive Order No. 2, s. 2016 or the FOI Program, the issued PCOO-DILG Joint Memorandum Circular 2018-01, the significant results and impact achieved in the 5th NAP Cycle (2019-2021), and the unwavering support and lobbying of FOI allies and partners, there is still a need to aggressively regain and reinvigorate the thrust of the FOI campaign not only at the national level but most importantly at the local level. This will only be achieved by reinstitutionalizing the program across the supply and demand spaces in the government, non-government, and public sectors, restrengthening inclusive and expansive localization efforts to help support demand for more granular information down to the grassroots and local level of government, redeveloping digital governance through digitalization of information and data disclosure, and revitalizing civic participation. Mirroring this challenge in the public’s access to information, the commitment is also bridging the gap of inclusively providing information across and within gender intersectionalities and multi-sectoral groups most especially the disenfranchised and the marginalized sectors who are barely tapped by the government and have limited to lack of capacity in engaging with the government sectors to request necessary information. Implemented since 2016, the FOI Program continues to battle against the rampant prevalence of misinformation, disinformation, malinformation, and fake news, circulating in both offline and online information platforms. Similarly the program provides an avenue for the citizens to share feedback regarding the information disclosure mechanisms of the government. Thus, the program actively and directly combats corruption thereby promoting transparency, accountability, and civic engagement in government processes. All this supports the constitutionally mandated right of the people to access public information as stipulated in Section 28, Article II and Section 7, Article III of the 1987 Philippine Constitution which serves as the backbone of stimulating and championing citizen’s participation in public governance, exercising the right to information and shaping public decisions affecting matters of public interest. Given this, this commitment aims to overcome bureaucratic inertia and the stagnation observed in the local and national FOI movement in the country. It does so by revitalizing the legitimacy and pre-existing initiatives of the FOI Program, and leveraging the momentum generated during the implementation of the program throughout the years since 2016 through aggressive localization and adoption of the program practice across the country.

2. What are the causes of the problem? The ultimate factor of this major problem is that the passage of the FOI Law has not been identified as a priority nor an urgent legislative measure in the previous congress and past administrations. This challenge in the legislation posits debacles on lack of political buy-in among legislators and local FOI champions. As underlying factors, the transition of the country under a new administration contributed to the shift of priority programs, leaving the FOI movement at the sidelines both at the national and local level. To add, the FOIPMO, which is the designated office that oversees the implementation of the FOI Program has undergone several physical office transitions from then Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) to Philippine Information Agency (PIA) by virtue of Executive Order No. 02, s. 2022, then back again under the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) by virtue of Executive Order No. 16, s. 2023. This office transition resulted in delayed transfer of budgets which then resulted in impeded activity implementation in various facets of the FOI Program. Undeniably, the change of FOI champions in various national government offices and local governments inflicted as well the dynamics of FOI implementation as numerous FOI officers, who are in charge of facilitating FOI requests, were replaced or removed. This further aggravated the institutionalization of FOI across the bureaucracy. In view also of this political temperament after the 2022 national elections, a number of staunch and dedicated FOI champions, partners, and allies, from a multitude of sectors, who campaigned aggressively for FOI Law, have inevitably grown tired into what is described as “advocacy fatigue” seeing that there was no concrete progress in the FOI lobbying despite the progressive engagements being spearheaded by FOI-PMO all throughout the years. This lack of an all-encompassing FOI law hinders the establishment of more open, transparent, and accountable governance by limiting the public’s access to public records, data, and other relevant information, and impeding the growth of community of practice and champions. As such, it is only worth noting that this commitment is designed to address bureaucratic inertia and the perceived status quo within the realm of FOI movement in the country by reinvigorating the campaign for more and wide localization of the FOI Program, reviving the pressure on the passage of the FOI Law, and restimulating the credibility and existing initiatives on access to information, while capitalizing on the momentum built during the program’s implementation since 2016. 

Commitment description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? As of this writing, the FOI-PMO has successfully carried out the following activities in support of the FOI Program, and in concurrence with the commitment to pass the FOI Law and localize the FOI Program. The achievements are clustered according to outcome areas: 

Proactive Disclosure of Information (Transparency) 1. Continuous onboarding of agencies to the Electronic FOI (eFOI) Portal which enabled other government agencies and local governments to take part and promote proactive disclosure of information. As of writing, a total of five hundred ninety (590) government agencies have been boarded in the portal, which is about 97% significant increase of onboarded agencies from 2017. 

Timely and Responsive Disclosure of Information (Transparency) 1. Consistently improving information dissemination processes and practices through enhanced implementation and key features of the eFOI Portal. As of now, a number of Artificial Intelligence (AI)- based improvements have been deployed in the portal including the (a) Agency Recommender System which matches information requests with the top agencies that holds FOI user’s requested information, (b) Automated Personally Identifiable Information Redactor (APIIR) which detects and removes sensitive information of the FOI users in the information requests, and the Topical and Thematic Modeling of Information Requests (TMI) which optimizes the portal’s search engine and retrieval of information by processing, analyzing, and producing trends analysis through thematic modeling techniques. These advancements in the portal intended to increase the platform’s usability and efficiency in enabling the citizens to openly access government information. 

Passage of FOI Law (Accountability, Transparency) 1. Drafted an administration version of the FOI Bill and lobbied to FOI Champions in congress. The draft administration FOI Bill was submitted to FOI Champions and a total of forty-six (46) lobbying and legislative engagements with the Congress were conducted and facilitated. As of writing, the FOI-PMO revived contacts and engagements with select offices and initially established connections in order to reintroduce the strength and essence of the FOI Program and the need for the passage of the FOI Law. 2. Requested the certification of the FOI as an urgent legislative agenda by the Office of the President (OP) or the inclusion of the FOI as a part of the President’s Legislative Agenda. However, the previous congress neither prioritized the FOI Bill as an urgent legislative measure nor has it submitted a committee report recommending the approval and issuance of a consolidated or substitute bill on FOI. As of writing, the FOI-PMO re-established connections with the OP in order to make the FOI Program a part of the legislative agenda under the new administration. 

Localization of the FOI Program (Accountability) 1. To complement the localization efforts, FOI-PMO also banked on proactive capacity-building and consultation activities with LGUs and local government champions. A total of thirty (30) local engagements were facilitated. As of this writing, the number also of LGUs that have enacted FOI Ordinances in their respective localities significantly increased from only sixty-three (63) in 2022 to seventy-four (74). 

Bureaucracy (Accountability) 1. Increased participation and presence in international fora. FOI-PMO has been consistently recognized by international organizations in relation to its access to information and open data initiatives in order to apply best global practices on access to information worldwide. Just recently, the FOI-PMO, as the first country in Asia to become a member of the International Conference of Information Commissioners (ICIC), successfully held the 14th edition of the ICIC which gathered eighty (80) Information Commissioners around the world. The ICIC is an international organization and network of Information Commissioners and Ombudspersons and other right to information (RTI) bodies which seeks to promote and protect the implementation of access to information laws to improve the public’s right to access information and build and share knowledge and best practices on transparency and accountability globally. This momentum gave the FOI-PMO the opportunity to showcase in the international space the remarkable strength of the FOI practice in the country despite the little to lack of support for the passage of FOI Law in the country. 

Public Use and Relevance of the FOI Program (Participation) 1. Conducted thirty (30) public consultations activities and strengthened capacity development activities with and for FOI key stakeholders to elicit feedback on the implementation of the FOI Program and the FOI Bill. As of this writing, the FOI-PMO further improved the feedback gathering on FOI through the Client Satisfaction Survey/Feedback Mechanism. Through this, the citizens are given the appropriate means to relay and report its concerns on any issues they may encounter in lodging FOI requests. 2. FOI Program activities have been inclusive in nature. FOI-PMO ensured the participation and empowerment of various marginalized and disenfranchised sectors to access information, thus, giving premium to the multi-sectoral approach of capacity-building. As of this writing, FOI-PMO has been rolling out numerous engagements with various sectors such as FOI Bridging Program, CSO Hangouts, FOI Summit, FOI Talks, among others. Through these engagements FOI-PMO have capacitated sectors such as Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDL), Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), Senior Citizens, Indigenous Peoples (IPs), LGBTQIA+, Women, Youth, Business groups, and etc. Under this commitment more sectors will be tapped and engaged with such as the farmers, fisherfolks, urban poor, formal and information labor workers, children, and cooperatives among others. 

In light of this, despite the remarkable progress and developments achieved by the FOI Program implementation in the previous NAP Cycle, the FOI Program commitment under the 6th NAP Cycle remains vital and pivotal in rebuilding, sustaining, and tighten up the fulcrum of access to information practice and momentum to combat bureaucratic inertia and plateau on the FOI movement and campaign in the Philippines. 

2. What solution are you proposing? While the passage of the FOI Law is the ultimate and ambitious goal of this commitment which will mandate the disclosure of government information and streamline access to information platforms across all sectors, it is still imperative to set the realistic political landscape of the country under a newly transitioned government from the Duterte Administration to the Marcos Administration in which prioritization of the FOI Program is not seen as a primary legislative and local agenda. With this, it should be noted that the administration and local governments’ support are beyond elemental in localizing the FOI Program and expediting the passage of an FOI Law. The FOI-PMO will rebuild and level up on implementing its recalibrated existing programs, activities, and projects, through aggressive lobbying for the adoption of the local FOI Ordinances/Executive Orders and other critical measures supporting the implementation of the said program. Furthermore, the commitment fosters greater innovation with the application of the AI-powered programs to help in localizing and digitalizing the FOI Program while also integrating feedback mechanisms to ensure citizencentric agenda of the FOI Program in the country. Thus, the following FOI practices and activities clustered according to outcome area shall be re-enrolled to suffice the commitment: 

Proactive Disclosure of Information (Transparency) 1. Increase the number of onboarded agencies to the eFOI Portal to promote proactive disclosure of information from five hundred ninety (590) to nine hundred thirty-two (932). 2. Increase the number of records and consolidated Agency Information Inventory (AII). 

Timely and Responsive Disclosure of Information (Transparency) 1. Digitalize access to information through enhanced application and features of the eFOI Portal. More AIpowered applications are to be deployed to increase the platform’s usability and efficiency in enabling the citizens to openly access government information. 2. Enhance capacity development engagements and deepen knowledge sharing among FOI Officers in facilitating FOI requests. 3. Increase the number of FOI Officers onboarded and designated across government agencies. 4. Increase the success rate in processing requests in the eFOI portal from 58% to 61%. 5. Decrease the number of average working days processing time of FOI requests from seven (7) to four (4). 

Passage of FOI Law (Accountability, Transparency) 1. Aggressively reintroduce the administration version of the FOI Bill in Congress and revive contacts and engagements with select offices to spotlight strength of the FOI Program and the pressure to pass the FOI Law in the country. 2. Re-establish connections and engagements with the OP to reintegrate the FOI Program as a part of the legislative agenda under the Marcos Administration. 

Localization of the FOI Program (Accountability) 1. Proactively reintroduce the FOI Program to localize adoption of FOI Ordinances in the local government units nationwide. 2. Increase the number of passed and implemented FOI Ordinances versus the total number of LGUs in the Philippines 3. Enhance capacity development engagements and deepen knowledge sharing among local FOI Officers in facilitating FOI requests. 4. Increase embeddedness of FOI in local government processes. 

Bureaucracy (Accountability) 1. Reconsolidate key stakeholders to target FOI Champions in the government and non-government sectors. 2.

Increase participation and presence in international fora and conference to consistently adopt global best FOI Practices. 4. Increase the number of FOI Manuals compliance. 

Public Use and Relevance of the FOI Program (Participation) 1. Aggressively and proactively campaign for the inclusion of the FOI Program to the CSOs Agenda. These CSOs Agenda is the advocacy/causes campaign of the partner CSOs. 2. Strengthened conduct of nationwide Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) capacitydevelopment engagements across and between gender intersectionalities, basic sectors, and target stakeholders. 3.

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? Ultimately, the overarching aim of this commitment is the ambitious nationwide adoption of the FOI Program at all LGU levels and the passage of the FOI Law, both critical and transformative goals requiring mandatory government information disclosure and streamlined access across sectors; however, it is still essential to acknowledge the pragmatic political environment and temperament. This is particularly crucial in the context of the recent transition from the Duterte Administration to the Marcos Administration. In this political landscape, it is imperative to recognize that various LGUs have only just begun with its local development plans (LDPs) and certification of the FOI Law's passage is not currently prioritized on the legislative agenda, nor has it received urgent certification in the previous congress. Nevertheless, the commitment still anchors on the target results to be achieved in the four-year implementation of the 6th NAP Cycle:  

Proactive Disclosure of Information (Transparency) 1. Number of onboarded agencies to the eFOI Portal to promote proactive disclosure of information increased from five hundred ninety (590) to nine hundred thirty-two (932). 2. Number of records and consolidated Agency Information Inventory increased 

Timely and Responsive Disclosure of Information (Transparency) 1. Access to information digitalized through enhanced application and features of the eFOI Portal. More AI-powered applications deployed to increase the platform’s usability and efficiency in enabling the citizens to openly access government information. 2. Capacity development engagements enhanced and knowledge sharing among national FOI Officers in facilitating FOI requests deepened. 3. Number of FOI Officers onboarded and designated across government agencies increased. 4. Success rate in processing requests in the eFOI portal increased from 58% to 61%. 5. Number of average working days processing time of FOI requests decreased from seven (7) to four (4). 

Passage of FOI Law (Accountability, Transparency) 1. Administration version of the FOI Bill in Congress aggressively reintroduced and contacts and engagements with select offices revived to spotlight strength of the FOI Program and the pressure to pass the FOI Law in the country. 2. Connections and engagements with the OP re-established and sustained to reintegrate the FOI Program as a part of the legislative agenda under the Marcos Administration. 

Localization of the FOI Program (Accountability) 1. FOI Program proactively reintroduced to localize adoption of FOI Ordinances in the local government units nationwide. 2. Number of passed and implemented FOI Ordinances increased. 3. Capacity development engagements enhanced and knowledge sharing among local FOI Officers in facilitating FOI requests deepened. 4. Embeddedness of FOI in local government processes increased. 

Bureaucracy (Accountability) 1. Key stakeholders and FOI Champions in the government and non-government sectors re-consolidated. 2. Research and development (R&D) approach on FOI enhanced to continue proactive monitoring and evaluation of the FOI Program implementation both at the national and local levels. 3. Participation and presence in international fora and conference increased and recognized meaningfully to consistently adopt global best FOI Practices. 4. Number of FOI Manuals compliance increased. 

Public Use and Relevance of the FOI Program (Participation) 1. Aggressively and proactively campaign for the inclusion of the FOI Program to the CSOs Agenda. These CSOs Agenda is the advocacy/causes campaign of the partner CSOs. 2. Conduct of nationwide Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) capacity-development engagements across and between gender intersectionalities, basic sectors, and target stakeholders increased and improved. 3. Citizen feedback mechanism through stakeholders consultation and public/online survey enhanced. Through this, the citizens are given the appropriate means to relay and report its concerns on any issues they may encounter in lodging FOI requests via the improved Client Satisfaction Survey/Feedback. 4. eFOI users registered nationwide increased. 

Additional Information 

1. The passage of the FOI Law and the localization of the FOI Program significantly contribute to and are aligned with the Marcos Administration’s good governance agenda as espoused through the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028 under Chapter 14: Practice Good Governance and Improve Bureaucratic Efficiency of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). 2. Localization and adoption of the FOI Program are reiterated through PCOO-DILG Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) 2018-01. 3. The FOI Program is inherently supported in the enactment of seventy (76) FOI Ordinances implemented nationwide. 4. Public access to information is under the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 16.10.2. 5. The total approved budget for 2023 is PHP 34,163,000.00. 

Commitment Analysis 

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? Transparency in this commitment is promoted through scaled up proactive, timely, and responsive disclosure of information of the bureaucracy including the national and local government units. In here, transparency is illuminated by increasing the number of onboarded agencies to the eFOI Portal, increasing the number of records and consolidated Agency Information Inventory disclosed to the public, increasing the number of FOI Officers capacitated to facilitate FOI requests, increasing the number of success rate in processing requests, and decreasing the number of average working days in processing information requests. With this, the FOI commitment promotes transparency by upholding greater awareness of the public, enabling and empowering the citizenry to request and ask for national and local public information; and enabling the government offices to disclose public information to the citizens. This ensures that the government is committed to delivering public service and cascading the information needs of the public thereby stimulating even more public participation, citizen engagement, and accountability. 

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? Accountability in this commitment is fostered through the localization of the FOI Program and passage of the FOI Law and all the activities implemented that fall under this in order to achieve the ultimate goal of a localized FOI implementation. With the FOI Program being reintroduced to FOI Champions and legislators, more national and local bureaucratic officials would be held accountable in disclosing public and government information to the citizens. The FOI would regain support at the national level; while the FOI Ordinance would exponentially increase, thereby producing proof of concepts, success models, and success stories that FOI works despite some gridlocks in the bureaucracy. With this, the goal to have the FOI Program localized and nationalized fosters greater accountability by ensuring that national government agencies and local government units comply with disclosing timely, relevant, and accurate information that are critical to the public interest. The FOI Program will support transparent and equal monitoring and evaluation systems by validating stricter compliance of government agencies, providing the public with access to the information and platforms necessary to assess and give feedback on the effectiveness of the government agencies’ proactive and reactive information disclosure processes, including implementation of its programs, projects, and other public services. 

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? Participation in this commitment is improved by elevating the public use, feedback mechanism, and legitimacy of the FOI Program to the general public, FOI users, FOI allies and supporters, and FOI champions, and having people-centric dialogues and consultations for feedback gathering. With the FOI Program reintroduced to various stakeholders, the relevance of the FOI Practice is revived and renewed in such a way that more CSOs would adopt the community of practice of access to information, increased FOI users are capacitated and registered nationwide, and the citizen are further empowered to provide feedback through the improved client satisfaction survey and appeals mechanism. With this, the goal to improve citizen participation is magnified through their increased ability to openly and regularly provide feedback, raise concerns and ideas, and participate in defining, implementing, and comonitoring solutions through a developed participatory approach such as the FOI citizen engagement feedback tracker/mechanism which involves public consultations, public and online surveys, and hosting of stakeholders meetings enabling the citizens to inform the government regarding critical technical feedback on the general implementation of the FOI Program and the commitment milestones activities including but not limited to the significant improvements, challenges encountered, and proposed resolutions. Finally, tapped and engaged social sectors would increase and deepen including the 14 basic sectors according to NAPC.

PH0068,Philippines,6,2A,PHL,Asia and the Pacific,National,1,2023,2027,4,NA,Establishment of more justice zones and enhancement of existing ones,Expanding and Enhancing Justice Zones,"Brief Description of the Commitment 

Overall, the commitment is geared towards enhanced administration of justice through intensified justice sector coordination at the local level, which is implemented through the Justice Zones. Four milestones are laid out under this commitment: (1) increase in the number of Justice Zones nationwide; (2) setup of Transparency Boards in all Justice zones; (3) jail decongestion efforts; and (4) enhancing psychosocial rehabilitation for drug dependent persons.

Problem Definition 

1. What problem does the commitment aim to address? 

a. Lack of access to justice is a recurring theme when one is asked to describe the Philippines’ justice system. While the reasons therefor vary from sector to sector, the fragmented approach employed by the justice sector actors in addressing justice issues and concerns is easily identified as the root cause that eventually affects one’s access to justice. Considering the myriad of justice sector agencies, a person may find himself or herself at a loss as to which agency can provide the proper relief. It thus becomes incumbent on the justice sector agencies to collectively assess and improve the user experience of the service users in the locality at different stages of the legal process. The primary and overarching problem sought to be remedied by the establishment of Justice Zones and the enhancement of existing ones is the fragmented manner by which the different institutions in the justice system operate, especially at the local level. The various pillars of the justice system have long been accustomed to performing their respective roles in the system with narrow focus on their own spheres of authority. They act independently of each other despite having the same service users. This approach often results in finger-pointing and blame passing: the courts dismiss the cases for lack of evidence, blaming the prosecution; the fiscals, in turn, blame the police for lack of better evidence gathering or handling; and the police blame the courts and the prosecutors for lack of policy guidance or inconsistency in procedures or requirements. To address this fragmented approach, Justice Zones have been created to serve as avenues, not just for the traditional “cooperation” among these institutions at the local level, but for their unified action as a sector. This initiative promotes a “sector perspective” in the performance of the institutions’ respective roles. It has thus become necessary to establish more Justice Zones in different parts of the country to replicate and build on the successes of the existing Justice Zones in their localities. 

b. Another matter to address is the lack of publicly available data on the number of cases filed and disposed of by the different courts. The data can be used by non-government actors to assess the performance of each court and its staff. Building on the Naga City Justice Zone’s practice of displaying its courts’ data for public viewing and utilizing technology, a Transparency Board will be available online to promote transparency and accountability. Later, other Justice Zones will also be directed to provide data for their own Transparency Boards. Once the data from several Justice Zones become available, a microsite dedicated for these boards can be set up and linked to the Supreme Court or the Office of the Court Administrator’s website. 

c. A significant challenge in the justice system is the congestion of jails, which not only negatively impacts the health of the persons deprived of liberty but also reflects the pace at which their cases are handled. It has been reported that the nationwide congestion rate is at 370% and that 336, out of 447 jail facilities in the country, are at full capacity.1 While several efforts have been made to improve these numbers, more still needs to be done. For this reason, a jail decongestion project will be conducted with the objectives of reducing admissions, increasing releases, and expanding the capacities of jail facilities. This project would need the engagement for civil service organizations, especially those providing legal aid services, to contribute to the discussion and in proposing solutions to the identified issues and problems relative to jail congestion.

d. As regards drug cases, re-offending was identified as a problem due to drug dependency. Rather than punish reoffenders, a more holistic solution that will address the root cause of the problem is to provide psychosocial rehabilitation to them. This hopes to not only steer them away from committing crimes or taking prohibited drugs again but give them direction after their release. 

2. What are the causes of the problem? The various pillars of the justice system have long been accustomed to a fragmented approach of accomplishing the tasks within their respective spheres of authority, acting independently of each other. As regards the criminal justice system, the five pillars are: (a) the courts; (b) prosecution and public attorneys; (c) correction facilities; (d) law enforcement; and (e) community. Prior to the creation of the JSCC and the Justice Zones, the lack of intensified coordination efforts hindered the identification and implementation of holistic solutions that require a multi-stakeholder approach. 

Commitment description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? Background:  April 30, 2010 marked the establishment of the Justice Sector Coordinating Council (JSCC), which is composed of the institutions in the justice system, specifically the Supreme Court, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Interior and Local Government. The JSCC member institutions aim to (a) work on cross-cutting issues affecting the justice system while at the same time, respect and preserve the independence of the offices and agencies, (b) adopt a coordinated approach to justice sector policy making, planning, and operations; and (c) identify priority issues and challenges that may be collectively addressed and meet on a regular basis.  The JSCC’s flagship program for justice sector coordination at the local level is the establishment of Justice Zones. These are areas or localities where several inter-agency coordinative reforms are present based on pre- identified elements, which cover the entire lifetime of a criminal case: from case start-up (initiatory complaint, arrest, investigation, case build-up), to case adjudication (prosecution, pre-judgment detention, decision), post- judgment incidents (probation, parole, service of sentence).  To date, 12 Justice Zones have been established nationwide. (i.e., Quezon City in 2014; Cebu City in 2018; Davao City, Angeles, Bacolod City and Naga City – all in 2019; Calamba City in 2021; Balanga City and Baguio City in 2022; Zamboanga City, Tagaytay City, and Puerto Princesa City in 2023). These Justice Zones have proven to be effective mechanisms and platforms for coordination among the local justice sector stakeholders.  Notably, the JSCC has decided to constitute “specialty Justice Zones” which will focus on specific areas of concern. For instance, Zamboanga City is the first specialty Justice Zone that focuses on trafficking in persons cases and is envisioned as a “Trafficking-Free” Justice Zone, while the Tagaytay City Justice Zone focuses on economic development and tourism. The Puerto Princesa Justice Zone is the first ever Green Zone, not only in the Philippines, but also in the Asia-Pacific Region. It was launched last November 10, 2023.  During the series of Justice Zones Dialogues in 2022 and 2023, the JSCC Technical Working Group on Processes and Capacity Building (PCB) identified activities that can be adopted in all Justice Zones. The activities were categorized into these four focus areas: Barangay Justice System; Jail Decongestion; Rehabilitation and Reintegration; and Gender and Social Inclusion. Selected activities under these areas are specified in this document as part of the commitment to enhance the administration of justice.  Notably, the targets of setting up Transparency Boards, conducting jail decongestion programs, and providing psychosocial rehabilitation to drug depedents are just some of the activities in the existing Justice Zones that are envisioned to be replicated in all Justice Zones nationwide. The ultimate objective is to enhance the administration of justice in a manner that is felt at the local level. 

2. What solution are you proposing? To recap, these are the solutions or activities to be implemented: 1. The establishment of more Justice Zones nationwide to proactively address the challenges of the justice sector institutions in their respective localities 2. The creation of digital Transparency Boards to promote transparency and accountability by having publicly viewable information regarding the cases initiated and disposed of in each court 3. The conduct of jail congestion programs in all Justice Zones, which will start with a national summit 4. The inclusion of psychosocial rehabilitation aspect in drug-related cases 

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? The completion of the above-mentioned solutions is envisioned to result in the more holistic approach of the different institutions involved in the justice system. The specific metrics for success of these endeavors are detailed later in this form. 

Additional Information 

This commitment is in line with Chapter 13.2 of the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028, Enhance Administration of Justice, as well as the Strategic Plan for Judicial Innovations (SPJI) 2022-2027.

Commitment analysis

1. How will the commitment promote transparency? The commitment will improve the citizens’ understanding of how the justice system works. In turn, the trust of the citizens in the justice sector will greatly improve with the raised awareness of how the processes and actors work, leaving no room for doubt and speculation. This is achieved by expanding the justice system’s reach to various citizens in different localities of the Philippines and allowing them to become more aware and familiar with the different modalities of attaining justice and by displaying relevant and updated information of the lead officers and agencies which are responsible in addressing the citizens’ concerns and issues. 

2. How will the commitment help foster accountability? The clear designation of tasks between and among justice sector actors will allow the public to pinpoint the stages and actors where delays and other issues occur, to identify and exact accountability and to address inefficiencies. This is achieved by making the responsible heads, officers and agents of the three justice sector institutions mindful of their duties to the citizens not only in Metro Manila but also across the Philippines. Expanding the reach of the justice system imposes upon the said responsible personalities the duty to ensure the effective and timely delivery of justice in far flung areas, knowing that more people can better monitor and access who are the designated authorities. 

3. How will the commitment improve citizen participation in defining, implementing, and monitoring solutions? Citizen participation is essential in the success of a Justice Zone. The community, as a pillar of the Justice Sector, plays an important role in the success of every Justice Zone. In particular, the community through the Barangays spearhead the Barangay Justice System to screen disputes from entering the formal court system. Likewise, in the area of psycho-social rehabilitation and community integration, the community takes a leadership role. This is achieved by providing more relevant and timely information to the citizens which are useful in their assessment of the changes and development of the criminal justice system in the Philippines. Expanding the presence of the different justice sector institutions will drive the curiosity of the citizens who, in effect, would be more engaged and vigilant of their rights and privileges.

What is the public problem that the commitment will address? With quantitative increase in citizen participation systems and channels over the last few years, opportunities for citizen participation have increased* greatly. • Public Petition (~end of April 2020): 826,156 petitions (an average of 837 petitions per day), 136.35 million signatures • Increase in Gwanghwamoon 1st Street members: 40,000 members in 2019 → 263,000 members in December 2020 • Open Communication Forum: 11 Forums hosted in 2019 with 838 participants → 13 Forums hosted in 2020 with 2,923 participants • Citizen Forum policy proposals: a total of 3,595 policy proposals → 67 selected as government innovation tasks The importance of connecting and integrating the participation platforms of multiple ministries to ensure substantial results from expanded participation opportunities has been emphasized. Also, in a time where offline participation in the policy making process has weakened due to COVID-19, reinforcing and promoting citizen participation systems through flexible operation of on- and off-line public participation channels has gained importance. 

What is the commitment? The government will improve laws and policies to support citizen participation and lay the foundation to boost citizen participation by connecting different participation platforms and strengthening the function of on- and off-line public platforms for policy discussions. 

How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? • Connect participation channels of multiple ministries via Gwanghwamoon 1st Street, develop public suggestions into policies and provide feedback through Big data analysis. • Thoroughly prepare* for the implementation of the first amendment of the Petition Act in 60 years to ensure people’s right to petition. * Enact an Enforcement Decree, establish an online system, train relevant organizations, conduct nationwide promotions, etc. • Promote the ‘pre-notification of policies for citizens to participate in’ system which preselects major policies of different ministries for citizens to participate in, uploads them on ministry websites and the Gwanghwamoon 1st Street citizen participation platform and later discloses the results to ensure accountability. • Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, enhance participation by operating an on- and off-line Gwanghwamoon 1st Street, Open Communication Forum, a platform where citizens, experts and public officials discuss social issues closely related to people’s daily lives. • When policy proposals submitted to the Gwanghwamoon 1st Street citizen participation platform go through adequate public discussion, further develop the proposal with the proposer, relevant experts and responsible public officials to reflect the proposals in policies through the Government Innovation Citizen Forum and Government Innovation Committee. This process is to be disclosed on the citizen participation platform.

What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Expanding the safety net for whistleblowers such as ensuring confidentiality and strengthening exemption from responsibility is necessary because there is still a lack of general awareness that the whistleblower protection system is a trustworthy system for reporting, even with continued efforts to revise relevant laws. * 67.5% of respondents pointed to ‘subsequent career-related disadvantages due to whistleblowing’ as a barrier to whistleblowing. (2019 Corruption Perceptions Survey, 1,400 citizens respondents) Besides strengthening the whistleblower protection system, providing practical incentives to encourage insider whistleblowing is necessary as major cases of corruption are difficult to detect without insider whistleblowing disclosure. 

What is the commitment? (Strengthen confidentiality for whistleblowers) Create effective sanctions for when the whistleblower’s identity is disclosed due to negligence. (Expand exemption from responsibility) Lay the legal grounds for public institutions to reduce disciplinary actions or administrative measures against the whistleblower or exempt the whistleblower from such disciplinary actions or administrative measures without the commission’s request. (Expand relief funds) Expand relief funds to cover expenses incurred in the civil and criminal litigation procedures resulting from whistleblowing. - Provide financial support, including attorney fees, when the whistleblower is charged with false accusations, defamation or obstruction of business. (Support non-real name disclosures by proxy) Ease the financial burden of whistleblowers by supporting expenses incurred in non-real name disclosures by proxy. ⇨ (Expected effect) Encourage whistleblowing by strengthening the whistleblower safety net and expanding financial support measures. 

How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? The commitment will strengthen protection and increase financial support for whistleblowers by amending the Act on the Prevention of Corruption and the Establishment and Management of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission and the Protection of Public Interest Reporters Act.

Guarantees access to information and promotes social participation of the vulnerable by closing the digital divide.

What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Although the spread of intelligent information technology in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era can have a positive impact on all areas of society and the economy, there is also the possibility that a gap in accessibility and utilization related to ever-advancing digital technology may exacerbate social and economic inequality and discrimination. Furthermore, the government is promoting non-face-to-face industries such as online education and digital work to prepare for the post-COVID-19 era, but without digital inclusion, the vulnerable may be left out on both the supply and demand sides. We must prepare for the post-COVID-19 era so that everyone can go beyond simply collecting information to move toward the goal of engaging in economic activity by utilizing digital technologies and improving overall quality of life. It is time for digital utilization policies to bridge the digital divide and realize the vision of an innovative and inclusive nation in the face of digital transformation. 

What is the commitment? 1) Enhancing the digital capabilities of the entire nation (Current Situation) Group education on information for the vulnerable such as the elderly, the disabled and multicultural families is being carried out in welfare centers, gu (district)-offices and community service centers but there are limitations in terms of accessibility as such education is mainly provided in facilities for the vulnerable and the actual number of people taking such programs falls far behind the number of people eligible for such programs. Although a considerable proportion of the general public lack the digital capabilities required in an intelligent information society, political interest in this issue was not as strong as it could have been. (Future Plans) First, the Korean government will expand the basis of nationwide offline digital education by utilizing existing residential infrastructure. To be specific, the government will operate 1,000 digital learning centers located in residential infrastructure such as libraries, welfare centers and community service centers targeting certain vulnerable classes such as the elderly, the disabled and multicultural families, and expand such programs to reach anyone lacking digital capabilities. Education will be on basic digital skills required in everyday life such as booking train tickets and banking using smartphones and ways to prevent cyber fraud. 1:1 visits will be made to provide digital education to people with severe disabilities who have impaired mobility or cannot participate in group classes. Second, the government will develop a scale measuring digital skills for anyone who wishes to do so and build an integrated online platform for education catering to different levels and circumstances. 2) Fostering an inclusive digital user environment (Current Situation) The Korean government is improving the broadcasting and communications user environment for rural residents and the disabled by providing nationwide affordable high-speed internet. However, there is still a substantial gap in terms of digital device ownership according to class and income levels. (Future Plans) First, the Korean government will build internet infrastructure that can be enjoyed nationwide and expand public Wi-Fi service to narrow the digital divide between cities and rural areas. It will also expand high-speed internet access by building high-speed internet infrastructure in more than 1,300 rural areas that have relatively weaker internet connectivity. Second, the government will provide support for the vulnerable classes through smart devices and telecommunications cost subsidies needed to ensure minimum digital technology adoption in the digital era. 3) Laying the foundation for digital inclusion (Current Situation) Private digital companies are promoting various digital inclusion activities such as closing the digital divide as part of CSR activities. The government’s active efforts to actively utilize the private sector’s participation and capability in the process of policy making and carrying out projects to alleviate digital inequality are needed. Continued interest and legal and institutional support to close the digital divide are necessary as this remains an inevitable issue as long as technology continues to advance. Therefore, the government’s duty to close the digital divide and establish an implementation system for mid- to long-term policies and projects on digital inclusion needs to be stipulated by law. (Future Plans) The government will form and operate a digital inclusion coalition where both civil society and businesses participate, thereby coming up with relevant policies, improving laws and systems and systematically promoting nationwide campaigns. In addition, the government will promote the enactment of a digital inclusion law which includes the government’s duty to close the digital divide and establish an implementation system for digital inclusion related policies and projects. Furthermore, the government will identify factors in our laws and systems that can result in discrimination and exclusion targeted at the vulnerable with the rapid development of digital technology and preemptively come up with improvement plans. 

How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? The commitment will prevent deepening inequalities that may arise with digital transformation by promoting policies that reduce the digital divide and enhance the quality of life for the vulnerable by utilizing digital technology.

Background 

The public interest whistleblowing system is an effective system for controlling corruption throughout society as a whole, including public interest violations that occur in areas that are not easily monitored and checked by the administrative power and civil society. Korea and other major countries around the world have introduced public interest whistleblowing systems and continue to make efforts to revitalize public interest whistleblowing, but there are cases where public interest whistleblowers are not protected by law. In particular, there are still blind spots that are not protected by the Public Interest Whistleblower Protection Act as they are not included in the scope of public interest reporting even though they are highly relevant to the public interest. Protection and support systems are applied differently for each offense that is subject to reporting, such as corruption, infringement of public interest, fraudulent claims, fraudulent solicitation, and conflict of interest.

Details of the Commitment 

Establish a system to protect and support public interest whistleblowers 
- Enhance equity among whistleblower protection and support systems by improving the current legal system, which differs for each offense subject to reporting, including corruption, infringement of public interest, fraudulent claims, fraudulent solicitation, and conflict of interest*, so that whistleblowers can enjoy the same whistleblower protection and support system for reporting any corruption-related and public interest infringement. 
* Violations of laws stipulated to be reported in the Act on Anti-Corruption and the Establishment and Operation of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission, Public Interest Whistleblower Protection Act, Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, Public Fund Recovery Act, and the Act on the Prevention of Conflict of Interest Related to Duties of Public Servants.

Expand the range of whistleblower protection and support levels 
- Expand the range of “public interest infringement” through a comprehensive regulation of public interest infringement or amendments to targeted laws that define public interest infringement. 
- To eliminate blind spots regarding the public interest that are not covered by public interest whistleblowing and do not enjoy the protection and support system, laws that are not covered by public interest whistleblowing will be reviewed and included in the public interest whistleblowing if they are highly relevant to the public interest*. 
* Add the law under “laws that are subject to public interest infringements” of the Public Interest Whistleblower Protection Act annex. 
- In addition, the reason for payment of public interest report rewards has been expanded from “recovery of revenues of the central or local government” to “recovery of revenues of public institutions” and publicized to facilitate detection of public interest infringements committed by public institutions other than the central or local governments. 

Potential for Result 

Provide a safe environment for reporting and encourage citizen participation in anti-corruption and promote the public interest by improving the protection and support system for public interest whistleblowers and expanding the range of levels of public interest whistleblower protection and support.

But there is more to be done to deliver effective engagement that is consistent and inclusive and to deliver more local control. Primary objecive: Scottish Ministers and Scottish civil society want to see a step change in society and in how the Scottish Government does its work and to energise local democracy, to put people at the centre of the way public services work so that the people of Scotland are able to participate on a fair and equal basis in the design of Scotland’s public services and policies. This commitment identifies 3 specific strands of work for Government, working with civil society, to improve participation. Short description: We will improve citizen participation by: bringing local government functions closer to communities through the development of new legislation, ensuring the people who use public services are involved in designing them, and building an Open Government movement in Scotland. OGP challenge: This commitment will be guided by the Scottish Government principles for democratic renewal and public service reform as detailed above. We will engage widely on, and introduce legislation to bring local government functions, finance and democratic oversight closer to communities. Commit to working with all those involved in designing digital public services to ensure that the methods and tools we use for engaging citizens and service users in service design promote Scottish Government and OGP values relating to ensuring diversity and inclusion in government through developing/adapting service design tools and methods, and publishing guidance and benchmarks. Digital public services provide a key point of contact between citizens and the State as well as the means by which citizens can access open data and through which government can promote transparency and access. The ability to access public services digitally presents an enormous service design challenge to government, the public sector, and other actors involved in the delivery of public services.

The right of citizens to have access to information contained in administrative documents is a fundamental right recognized and enshrined in several national texts. However, its effectiveness remains relative, due in particular to the absence of a legal framework specifying the scope of the right of access to information as well as the conditions of its exercise. In addition, there is no operational mechanism for its implementation. 

What are the objectives of the commitment The main objective of this commitment is to pass the Access to Information Act and its subsequent legislation. Specifically, this consists in: • specifying the scope of the right of access to information and the procedures for its implementation; • providing citizens with administrative and judicial remedies to enforce this right; • establishing an independent administrative authority to promote and protect the right of access to information. 

How would the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? The commitment will allow Senegal to: • strengthen transparency and accountability ; • improve the quality of public debate by providing citizens with legal and operational means to build their opinions on the basis of reliable information drawn from authentic sources; • to improve the quality of services provided by public and private administrations to their users; 15 • to comply with its international commitments. 

Why is this commitment relevant to the values of the OGP This commitment corresponds to the OGP's values of transparency, citizen participation and accountability. It promotes openness to the public, improves the quality of citizen participation based on reliable information and facilitates objective citizen oversight. The commitment is also important for Senegal, which aims to raise its score on access to information from 2/4 to 4/4. The adoption of the law and its subsequent texts on the subject would be a major asset to achieve this goal.

After having adhered to several international anti-corruption instruments, Senegal set up OFNAC, by law n°2012-30 of December 28, 2012. This institution investigates cases and regularly submits reports to the public prosecutor implicating certain individuals. However, these reports are not always followed up. This can be explained, to some extent, by the absence of prerogatives of the OFNAC regarding the follow-up of investigation files transmitted to the competent judicial authorities. In addition, some of those authorities who are subjected to the declaration of assets do not fulfill this obligation, as provided for by Law No. 2014-17 of 2 April 2014, without being subject to sanctions. Consequently, strengthening the assignments of OFNAC would be a way of improving anti-corruption strategies and increasing the accountability and transparency of public action. 

What are the objectives of the commitment? The main objective of this commitment is to strengthen the assignments of OFNAC. Specifically, it consists in one hand of ensuring that follow-up is given to investigation files transmitted to the competent judicial authorities, and in another hand, of making the declaration of assets be effective for all those who are subjected to the law 

How would the commitment contribute to solving the public issue? The commitment will help: - strengthen the credibility of OFNAC - prevent corruption; and - improve the repression of corruption; - increase transparency in the management of public affairs and the follow-up of investigative files 21 

Why is this commitment relevant to the OGP values? The commitment refers to the principle of anti-corruption, transparency and accountability, promoting the integrity of public officials. 

Further information Senegal has a national anti-corruption strategy with three major axes: - Reform of the normative and institutional framework; - Improvement of governance and coordination of anticorruption interventions; - Improvement of communication and capacity building of anti-corruption actors (information, communication and education).

What public issue will the engagement address? Citizen access to information is a fundamental right recognized and enshrined in several international and national texts. However, its effectiveness remains relative, notably due to the non-adoption of the law on access to information and its subsequent texts. Added to this is the absence of an operational implementation system. 

What are the objectives of the commitment? The commitment aims to establish a legal framework that facilitates public access to information held by public authorities. The specific objectives consist of:1) Encourage compliance with international commitments and meet open governance standards; 2) Promote the transparency of government action by allowing citizens easy access to (public) information; 3) Allow citizens, researchers, media and organizations to access information; 4) Strengthen public confidence in governmental and constitutional institutions; Preventing crises by providing information to the public

How would the engagement help to solve the public problem? Fulfilling the commitment will allow Senegal to create an environment where information is available and accessible for citizens

Why is this commitment relevant to the values of the OGP? This commitment corresponds to the OGP values of transparency, citizen participation and accountability. 

Additional information 

The bill on access to information is in the validation process. He received a favorable opinion from the Supreme Court. Commitment is also important for Senegal, which aims to increase its score on access to information from 3/4 to 4/4.

What public issue will the engagement address? After having adhered to several international instruments to combat corruption, Senegal established the OFNAC, by Law No. 2012-30 of December 28, 2012. This institution investigates cases and files, regularly, with the Prosecutor of the Republic, reports which implicate certain people. However, these reports are not always acted upon. This is explained, to a certain extent, by the lack of prerogatives of the OFNAC regarding the follow-up of the investigation files transmitted to the competent judicial authorities. In addition, some subject to the asset declaration do not fulfill this obligation provided for by Law No. 2014-17 of April 2, 2014, without being subject to sanction. In addition, Senegal still does not have an anticorruption law and legal provisions that protect whistleblowers. Therefore, strengthening the powers of OFNAC and legal provisions would be a way to improve anti-corruption strategies and increase the accountability and transparency of public action. It is in this perspective that the government adopted and examined on November 22, 2023, in the Council of Ministers  The bill amending law no. 2012 - 30 of December 28, 2012 establishing the National Office for the Fight against Fraud and Corruption (OFNAC); And The bill amending law no. 2014 - 17 of April 2, 2014 relating to the declaration of assets. 

What are the objectives of the engagement ? The main objective of this commitment is to strengthen the powers of OFNAC and provide Senegal with an anti-corruption law. Specifically, this involves, on the one hand, ensuring that follow-up is given to investigation files transmitted to the competent judicial authorities and making the declaration of assets effective for all taxable persons; and on the other hand, adopt a general law on the fight against corruption. 

How would the engagement help to solve the public problem? The commitment will contribute to:  Strengthen the credibility of OFNAC;  Prevent corruption;  Improve the repression of corruption;  Make the management of public affairs and the monitoring of investigation files more transparent. 

Why is this commitment relevant to the values of the OGP? The commitment refers to the principle of the fight against corruption, transparency and accountability, by promoting the integrity of public officials.

Additional information 

Senegal has a national anti-corruption strategy which has three major axes: - Reform of the normative and institutional framework; - Improved governance and coordination of interventions in the fight against corruption;- Improved communication and capacity building of those involved in the fight against corruption (information, communication and education). The draft laws on OFNAC and on the declaration of assets were adopted by the Council of Ministers on November 22, 2023. A Scientific Committee has been set up to develop the preliminary draft anti-corruption law.

Current protection of whistleblowers is regulated by provisions of several laws and bylaws (the Law on Civil Servants, Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance and Law on Anti-Corruption Agency, the Rulebook on protection of a person who reported suspicion of corruption), and it is limited in its scope for several reasons (definition of a person enjoying protection, the extent of protection, cases in which protection is provided, non-regulated field of sanctions for those who take revenge, indemnity, or awarding of whistleblowers). Therefore, it is necessary to establish a uniform legal framework by enacting legislation that will regulate this area in a comprehensive manner. In addition, it is necessary to build public trust and trust of persons who are potential whistleblowers, that their full protection will be provided by the adoption of the law. In that sense, ministry in charge of justice has prepared Draft Law on Whistleblowers Protection, conducted the public debate, and text of the Draft law submitted to the Government.

The current revision aims to address certain deficiencies that have been observed in the implementation of the Law in practice. The Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance dates back to 2004. The Law has been praised as excellent in terms of its legislative arrangements, but its implementation in practice has revealed certain deficiencies. The Commissioner for Information of Public Importance received a similar number of complaints in 2014 and 2015 – about 4,000 – mostly in cases of the so-called administrative silence. This shows that the legal enforcement mechanisms cannot be fully implemented in practice. In addition, the supervisory authority in charge of implementation of this Law, the Administrative Inspectorate, has rarely used the option of imposing penalties for violations of the Law. Indeed, in recent years, entities that broke the Law were allowed to go unpunished on several occasions. The last two years saw progress in this regard, with the institution of infringement proceedings against a number of entities. However, taking into account that the Commissioner annually submits to Administrative inspection between 300 and 400 initiatives to initiate infringement proceedings, in cases of drastic violations of the right to free access to information of public interest, when the public authorities do not act according to the decision of the Commissioner, the number of infringement proceedings that are actually instituted remains very low. As the Law is currently being revised, these and other shortcomings might be eliminated in order to raise awareness of entities subject to the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance, as a constitutional category. Furthermore, the Action Plan on Development of e-Government also envisages the establishment of a legislative framework for open data and reuse of public sector information (to transpose the European Directive on Reuse of Public Sector Information) in the coming years. Main objective: Improved access to information; The future Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance must include the following provisions: 1. To ensure efficient oversight of lawfulness of operations of public administration bodies and other entities subject to administrative oversight and inspection for violations of the right of access to information of public importance, in compliance with the principle of independence of oversight authorities and the principles of good governance 2. To introduce the obligation to obtain an opinion of the Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection in the process of passing regulations, to the extent that those regulations fall within the remit of this authority 3. To improve the situation regarding enforcement of decisions passed by the Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection 4. To bring the amount of fines in compliance with the Law on Misdemeanours and to establish a protective mechanism to ensure the achieved level of freedom of information cannot be reduced by other regulations 5. To impose a duty on the authorities subject to this Law to proactively publish information of public importance Brief description of commitment (140-character limit): It is necessary to amend the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance to ensure the right of access to information and time limits set by the law are respected. The duty to proactively publish information should also be introduced. OGP challenge addressed by the commitment: Strengthening public integrity; Relevance: Improvement in the access to information of public importance through amendments of the Law will ensure a higher level of freedom of information, which is also one of the core values of the Partnership. Also, genuine advocacy of improved public administration and fight against corruption must entail transparency in the work of public authorities, while lack of accountability for denial of access information to the public encourages violations of the Law, as can be seen from the increasing number of complaints lodged with the Commissioner. The above amendments to the Law would ensure that these issues are properly addressed. Ambition: Amendments to the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance would address the issues which arose in the implementation of this Law in practice. Proper oversight of implementation of the Law and of the institute of enforcement of the Commissioner’s decisions would improve the exercise of the right of access to information and would raise awareness of the importance of this right among the entities subject to this Law. In addition, amendments to the Law which would vest the Commissioner with the power to give opinions in the process of enactment of laws would ensure that the existing level of protection of rights is not reduced by other laws and regulations. Amendments to the Law regarding proactive publishing of information would help reduce the number of appeals filed to the Commissioner due to violations of the right to free access to information of public interest, and improve respect for the right of access to information, which is also enshrined in the Constitution.",10/1/2016,12/31/2016,Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government - MPALSG,"Special Working Group on preparation of the Draft Law Amending the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance; CRTA – Centre for Research, Transparency and Accountability",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,ND,ND,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ND,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2018,ND,ND,High,3,Yes,1,0,1,0,1,Moderate,2,Limited,3,0,0,ND,ND,ND,ND,2019,Limited,3,No Change,0,ND,ND,Did Not Change,1,Did Not Change,2,Not Applicable,0,Did Not Change,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,3,PotImp,https://opengovpartnership.org/members/serbia/commitments/rs0020,2019,0,AP_SRB02,3056

This evaluation exercise covers also the websites of the bodies of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina and local self-governments. While the open data initiative has been gaining momentum in Serbia, the concept of open data and its beneficial effects are still not sufficiently recognised by state institutions. Certain progress has already been achieved: a feasibility study for open data in the Republic of Serbia has been conducted, a Working Group on Open Data has been formed and an initiative has been launched to draft a legislative framework for open data and reuse of public-sector information. The Guidelines have been recognised as a mechanism for promoting the open data initiative. In this context, constant efforts are underway to further improve the Guidelines. In parallel with this, drafting of a Law on eGovernment is underway, and one of the main implementing regulations passed pursuant to that Law would be a Bylaw on Development of Websites and Publishing of Electronic Services, which would be based on the Guidelines. Main objective: The aim is to keep the Guidelines as a means of improving access to information of public importance, while also promoting the publishing of data in a machine-readable format. The mandatory information which must be disclosed in the Information Booklet on the Work of Public Authorities is also required for the purpose of evaluation of websites of public administration and LSGU bodies based on the methodology approved by the Government, which is set out in the Guidelines for Evaluation of Websites of Public Administration Bodies. This methodology should take the form of an implementing regulation based on the new Law on eGovernment, i.e. the above-mentioned Bylaw. The Law on eGovernment should also provide for the establishment of metaregistries, which would specify the data included in the official records (databases) of public authorities, as well as for keeping of open data metaregistries which would be posted on the Open Data Portal. The Bylaw based on the Guidelines should provide for the publishing of all information of public importance, electronic services and budgets in an open, machine-readable format, as well as for the publishing of citizens’ budgets of local self-governments and the AP. Brief description of commitment (140-character limit): This Commitment will involve modification of the Guidelines and Criteria for Evaluation as they pertain to publishing of information of public importance, including budgets, in an open format. It will also include arrangements for entering information of public importance using a platform for automated data entry and generation of information booklets on the work of public authorities, as well as publishing of the content of those information booklets in several human-readable formats, as well as in an open machine-readable format. Such information includes also budget plans and budget execution. This measure will also define other aspects of websites, including the structure of websites of state authorities, and establishment of a metaregistry of data kept in official records and metaregistries of open data. Furthermore, provisions will be made for publishing of all parts of websites which contain information of public importance in an open format. OGP challenge addressed by the commitment: Strengthening public integrity; Relevance: By becoming a piece of secondary legislation, the Guidelines for Evaluation of Websites, which apply to state administration, autonomous province and local self-government bodies, could be used as a tool for improving the quality and scope of publishing of information of public importance and electronic services and could support the opening of new data sets. One of the steps involved in this measure will be to modify the Guidelines and, on their basis, develop and adopt an implementing regulation pursuant to the Law on eGovernment. It is expected that the Law will be drafted in December 2016. These efforts would highlight the added value Serbia has derived from the Open Government Partnership. Ambition: To put in place regulations which would provide for continual improvement of websites of all public administration bodies, publishing of e-services and opening of data, with the aim of ensuring transparency and user-friendliness.",NA,NA,MPALSG - eGovernment Directorate,"MPALSG, Commissioner for Information of Public Importance, Working Group on Development of the Guidelines; CRTA- Centre for Research, Transparency and Accountability",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ND,ND,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,ND,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2018,ND,ND,High,3,Yes,1,0,0,1,1,Moderate,2,Limited,3,0,0,ND,ND,ND,ND,2019,Substantial,4,Increase,1,ND,ND,Major,3,Major,4,Not Applicable,0,Not Applicable,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,2,4,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,4,PotImp,https://opengovpartnership.org/members/serbia/commitments/rs0022,2019,0,AP_SRB02,3058

Since the criteria for determining when a public hearing has to be held in the legislative process, as set out in the Law on Public Administration and the Government’s Rules of Procedure, are not sufficiently clear and are subject to different interpretations in practice, this issue should be addressed in detail through amendments to those regulations. Moreover, even when public hearings are held, stakeholders’ comments and suggestions are sometimes not taken into account and Ministries sometimes fail to explain in the reports of public hearings how they reviewed such suggestions and proposals, whether they accepted such suggestions and proposals and, if so, to what extent. Lack of public hearings and enactment of laws in an expedited procedure are detrimental to civic participation and transparency; furthermore, laws enacted in this way are as a rule deficient in some way and entail a certain level of corruption risks. Main objective: To create legal assumptions for public hearings and ensure that texts of draft laws submitted for public hearing are subsequently modified primarily as a result of acceptance of comments and suggestions made in the public hearing. This should apply to all laws, except in cases where certain precisely defined criteria are met that require immediate action, where the laws are passed to ratify international agreements or where the so-called “technical” amendments are made to laws, i.e. amendments which do not affect the existing conditions and the manner in which natural persons and legal entities exercise their rights and responsibilities etc. Cases when laws are enacted without a public hearing should be kept at an absolute minimum and this should be done only when strictly necessary, in urgent situations where postponement is not possible, in accordance with precisely defined criteria. Furthermore, a duty should be imposed on public authorities when drafting laws to post on their website all received proposals and comments, as well as reasons for accepting or rejecting those proposals, before providing a detailed report of the public hearing. Interactive relations should be established with stakeholders to ensure that any proposals and suggestions made during a public hearing are clearly conceived, consistent and as specific as possible. Brief description of commitment (140-character limit): Amendments to the Law on Public Administration and the Government’s Rules of Procedure as they pertain to mandatory public hearings in the drafting of laws. OGP challenge addressed by the commitment: Strengthening public integrity; Relevance: This commitment will clearly contribute to the attainment of all proclaimed principles of the Open Government Partnership – transparency and civic participation. Namely, amendments to these regulations should ensure that public hearings are held on a regular basis and that draft laws submitted for public hearing can subsequently be modified primarily as a result of acceptance of comments and suggestions made during public hearings; the amendments should also provide for publishing of all received proposals and comments, as well as reasons for accepting or rejecting such proposals. Ambition: Public hearings are held in the process of enactment of all laws, except in cases where certain precisely defined criteria are met that require immediate action, where the laws are passed to ratify international agreements or where the so-called “technical” amendments are made to laws, i.e. amendments which do not affect the existing conditions and the manner in which natural persons and legal entities exercise their rights and responsibilities etc. Furthermore, when drafting laws, public authorities post on their website all received proposals and comments, as well as reasons for accepting or rejecting those proposals.

The existing regulations (Law on Electronic Signature and Law on electronic Document) do not cover certain segments of use of electronic data, means of electronic communication and electronic processing of data in the transactions of natural persons and legal entities, including public administration bodies (e-business), which feeds into the fear that e-services make it impossible to verify the identity of a legal entity or natural persons, enable electronic identification and guarantee for the authenticity of specific data, all of which affects the openness of public administration. The Draft Law on Electronic Documents, Electronic Identification and Trusted Services in Electronic Business was prepared and public debate was conducted from 7-30. September 2016. The analysis of propositions and coments of the participants in the public debate is currently in progress and the preparation of the Draft Law that will be submitted to the competent state bodies for opinions, in order to be submited to the Government for approval. Main objective: Enactment of the proposed Law and its implementing regulations would complete the legal framework for establishing a common basis for electronic interactions between citizens, companies and public administration bodies and fostering greater trust in electronic transactions, online services, e-business and e-commerce. It is particularly important to put in place more detailed provisions pertaining to: generation and validation of electronic signatures and electronic stamps and their validity and power as evidence; registered electronic delivery service as an electronic data transmission service where the service provider provides evidence of handling of transmitted data; document conversion to different formats in a way which preserves the content; digitalisation of documents that were not originally made in an electronic form; provision of trusted services/electronic identification; website authentication; introduction of relevant registers in the field of e-business; and conditions for storing and archiving electronic documents. Brief description of commitment (140-character limit): The new Law will improve Serbia’s legal framework and harmonise it with the most recent EU regulations in this field by introducing provisions pertaining to electronic documents, electronic identification and trusted services in e-business. The Law will introduce registers of electronic identification service providers, trusted service providers and qualified devices for certificate generation, regulate long-term storage of information and legal validity of electronic signatures and stamps and provide for their validation regardless of future technological changes.

The Law will contribute to the attainment of core OGP values: technology and innovation as tools for achieving transparency and accountability. It will create conditions for fostering greater trust in electronic transactions and online services/e-business, which in turn will lead to greater transparency and accountability of public administration and civic participation in the drafting of regulations and decision-making.

(January 2019 - October 2019)
Lead implementing agency Ministry of Culture and Information
Business Registers Agency
Description of Commitment
Problem addressed by the
commitment
The proposed commitment should ensure greater transparency of
data on the spending of budget funds in the media sector.
Information on the total budget funding allocated to the media
sector is not fully available to the public because there is no official
data which would comprehensively present the total amount of
public funds allocated for the co-financing of projects and the
media through public calls, individual allocations, through
marketing or otherwise (public procurement, advertising etc.).
The Law on Public Information and Media provides for the
establishment of the Media Register as a central spot which would
ensure public availability of data on the media.
However, it is evident from the current state of operation of the
Media Register shows the need to amend the Bylaw on
Documentation Enclosed for Registration of the Media with the
Media Register in order to address the following issues:
• Money awarded to the media by the state is classified either as
“funds awarded as state aid” or as “funds not awarded on the basis
of state aid rules” (funds received by public authorities), which
means that these two very wide categories of financial allocations
are not defined in detail,
27
• Documents containing data on funds are clearly defined only for
funds awarded according to the state aid rules (a decision on
distribution of funds is submitted), while any document could be
used for the other categories of financial allocations,
• Data presentation is not satisfactory because an average user is
not able to easily find relevant data on financial allocations to the
media and cross-checking of data is not possible,
• The data on financial allocations in the Media Register are not
updated,
• The supervisory mechanism for compliance with the duty to
submit data on the amount of awarded money has several issues,
while sanctions are inadequate and not efficient enough.
Main objective 1. To amend the Bylaw on Documentation Enclosed for Registration
of the Media with the Media Register (lead implementing agency:
Ministry of Culture and Information) – It is necessary to: define
in detail the type of public funds awarded to the media; to define
time limits for submission of data to the registrar; to define in
detail the documents required to be submitted to the Media
Register and categories of data (in accordance with the
Recommendation 2 on improvement of technical performances of
the Register);
2. To improve technical performance and presentation of data in the
Media Register (lead implementing agency: BRA).
Categories of data which would be publicly available would include
the following:
• Identification data on the providers of state aid or contracting
authorities in public procurement procedures;
• The number, date and title of a decision on award of state aid or
the number, date and title of a decision on contract award in
public procurement procedures;
• Legal basis for the passing of a decision on award of state aid or a
decision on contract award;
• The amount of state aid or the value of contracts in public
procurement procedures;
• The source of funding (specific budget item from which state aid
or public procurement is financed);
• Other data as appropriate.
How will this commitment
contribute to problem solving?
Transparency of state subsidies is the first, key step in evaluation of
the total amount of money allocated to the media sector.
In addition, only full data and facilitated access to information on
money flows can ensure control of spending, i.e. whether the 
28
money has been spent for intended purposes and what effect it had
in terms of provision of information.
Access to information is also one of the most important anticorruption mechanisms.
The way in which this
commitment is relevant to
further advancing OGP values
The proposed commitment contributes to the achievement of
several key values and topics which are priorities of the OGP: it
ensures to the public and all interested parties access to information
of public importance, enables control of budget money spending
and also encourages accountability of public authorities which
handle budget money.
Additional information The basis for proposed changes, relevant researches, documents
and specific reasons for amendments to laws and secondary
legislation are available in the document titled Transparency of
Data on State Spending on Media Sector at: https://kazitrazi.rs/wpcontent/uploads/2017/11/TRANSPARENTNOST-PODATAKADRZAVNA-POTROSNJA.pdf

Lead implementing agency Public Policy Secretariat
Description of Commitment
Problem addressed by the
commitment
There is no integrated database of currently applicable
administrative requirements (procedures) in the existing public
administration system. For this reason, economic operators and
citizens wishing to start their own business often do not know
where to ask or how to find information about administrative
procedures and other conditions for pursuing a business activity
and costs of services provided by state administration bodies.
This often leads to unjustified additional expenses and waste of
time for public service users. In 2016, administrative expenses
of businesses equalled 3.46% of GDP. Once this commitment is
implemented, administrative expenses of businesses should be
cut by 15-20%, to 3% of GDP. A comprehensive and up-to-date
electronic database of administrative procedures and
requirements would give citizens and businesses ready access to
necessary information, thereby avoiding the incurrence of these
additional expenses.
Main objective A single public register is an objective pursued by the project
implemented by the Government of the Republic of Serbia
entitled ePAPER. The single public register of administrative
procedures is being established in parallel with a process of
simplification of administrative procedures and soliciting
initiatives from businesses and citizens for changes and
improvements to the existing processes. This public register will
give citizens and businesses access to all administrative
requirements and procedures that need to be achieved and met
in order to exercise a right or obligation. The register will 
39
provide all necessary information on the selected procedures –
the required documentation, the timeframe and the admissibility
of appeals, including all expenses in the form of fees, surcharges
etc. Simplification of the procedure, slashing of unnecessary
levies and digitalisation of the most common procedures will
reduce the business expenses of economic operators in the
pursuit of their business activity. This will increase
predictability and transparency of business. Communication
with economic operators is key for compliance with this
commitment, with recommendations and proposals for
simplification, modification or improvement of administrative
procedures, because it will be the best way to identify
procedures which lead to wasteful spending of resources of
economic operators, i.e. those that create the heaviest
administrative burden in terms of frequency, complexity or
expenses.
How will this commitment
contribute to problem solving?
The register will be a publicly available database of all
administrative procedures and other conditions for pursuing a
business activity imposed by public administration bodies and
organisations. Economic operators and citizens will have a onestop-shop where they will obtain all necessary information
relevant for a specific procedure, including: whether there is an
application form (to download); to whom the application should
be submitted and if it may be submitted electronically; what
other documentation is required, in what form and whether there
are steps to be completed before that (certification by a notary
public etc.); what are the financial expenses (fees, surcharges
etc.); the timeframe for deciding on applications; the validity
term of the issued document and the possibility of appeal.
Such publicly available information will help economic
operators save resources, leaving them more time to focus on
the pursuit of their business activity. Simplification of
procedures will reduce administrative burden by eliminating
obstacles to simple compliance of economic operators with their
obligations, which will make the business climate in the
Republic of Serbia more favourable and attractive to prospective
investors.
Implementation of this commitment began in June 2016, when
the Working Group held its first meeting. The following results
have been achieved to date: 84 authorities and organisations
actively participated in the inventorying of administrative
procedures; 35 trainings have been held for the representatives
of all authorities which participated in the inventorying of
administrative procedures, with 16 trainers of civil servants and 
40
479 civil servants from 107 authorities and organisations
trained; 2500 procedures have been inventoried in a uniform
manner; and an analysis has been made of almost all procedures
(99%), as a first step in the process of issuing recommendations
for simplification of administrative procedures.
In addition, a set of documents comprising the Methodology for
Simplification of Administrative Procedures has been prepared
(Guidance for Analysis of Simplification of Administrative
Procedures and Methodology for Calculating Administrative
Expenses). The first 254 recommendations for simplification of
procedures have been made. Five recommendations have been
accepted, which marks the beginning of implementation; three
of those recommendations will be fully implemented as of 1
January 2019, resulting in the abolishment of three procedures
and the saving of 3.6 billion dinars in expenses for the economy
in 2019.
The Draft Law on the Single Public Register is currently being
developed. It will constitute the legal basis for the establishment
of the Register and will set forth the obligations and duties of
state authorities in terms of data entry and updating.
A form for inventorying administrative requirements and other
conditions for the pursuit of business activity has been prepared
and trainings have been held for the civil servants who will be
inventorying these requirements.
The portal www.epapir.rsjp.gov.rs has been launched to solicit
initiatives for improvement and modification of existing
procedures and to ensure the necessary cooperation with
businesses.
The way in which this commitment
is relevant to further advancing
OGP values
Compliance with this commitment will improve the quality of
public services and improve the reputation of public
administration, facilitate communication between authorities
and enable data exchange. The Register will contribute to
greater transparency in the actions of public administration,
bring about to fewer opportunities for abuse and corruption and
facilitate day-to-day operations of economic operators.
Additional information Funding for the implementation of this commitment has been
secured from the following projects:
• Support to improvement of the business environment, an
EU Project (IPA 2013) worth EUR 2,301,120.
• Improving the Business Environment, a project of the UK
Good Governance Fund implemented by the International 
41
Financial Corporation (IFC), worth EUR 4,072,085.
• IPA project – Implementation of the Services Directive
2006/123/EC and establishment of a single electronic
contact point. The total approved amount is EUR 2,000,000
and the tendering procedure is underway.
• GIZ project Support to Public Administration Reform in

Description of Commitment
Problem addressed by the
commitment
The Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance,
which came into force in 2004, provides that transparency in the
work of public administration bodies can be achieved in two ways:
proactively and reactively. Proactive transparency implies timely
publishing of documents and availability of understandable
information for citizens. Information booklets on the work of
public authorities and their content are defined by the by the Law
on Free Access to Information of Public Importance and they
include information used or generated by public administration
bodies in their work. The currently applicable arrangement for
publishing the Information Booklets (in Word/PDF formats) and
the updating system lead to insufficient data, make any attempt at
oversight an arduous task and provide limited possibilities for
comparison of information, which reduces citizens’ overall
awareness of the issues.
46
The results of a survey carried out by the Belgrade Open School at
the local self-government unit level showed that information
booklets generally tend to lack the most sensitive information,
especially information about the budget, which was observed in
69% of all cases. Only 16% of all municipalities published
information about public procurement, while 11% published
information about awarded state aid and various forms of financial
support to public and other enterprises. About a half of all
information booklets of LSGUs in Serbia (47%) do not contain
information about e.g. documents and requirements necessary to
exercise a social security entitlement or about the issuance of a
certificate of registration with the register of births.
Main objective The planned amendments to the Law on Free Access to
Information of Public Importance, namely its Article 39 and Article
3 that defines the concept of a public authority body and the
concept of a government body within the meaning of this Law, to
which category of authorities refers obligation to publish the
Information Booklet, as well as amendments to the Instructions on
Preparation of Information Booklets, will see the information
contained in those Information Booklets reformatted with the aim
of opening the data contained therein, improving proactive
transparency and expanding the circle of administration bodies
subject to the legal requirement of publishing Information
Booklets. This will entail:
1) Development of a single IT system to access, process and
present the Information Booklet;
2) Designing a segment of an online platform that would serve as
an Information Booklet, coupled with an obligation for public
authorities to publish information booklets in PDF format;
3) Training of employees in government bodies for the use of a
single IT system;
4) Piloting the use of the application;
5) Promotion of the application (single IT system) for the public,
civil sector, business sector and the media.
Effectiveness of the amendments to Article 39 of the Law on Free
Access to Information of Public Importance would be delayed until
the online platform is designed (until technical requirements are
complied with).
How will this commitment
contribute to problem solving?
The planned amendments to the Law on Free Access to
Information of Public Importance, namely its Article 39 and Article
3 that defines the concept of a public authority body and the
concept of a government body within the meaning of this Law, to
which category of authorities refers obligation to publish the
Information Booklet, as well as amendments to the Instructions on
Preparation of Information Booklets, will see the information
contained in those Information Booklets reformatted with the aim
of opening the data contained therein and improving proactive
transparency. In addition, harmonisation of these two documents
would encourage the administration at all levels to open data in
accordance with the “Open Data Readiness Assessment” published
in December 2015.
In order to increase civic participation, it will first be necessary to 
47
raise citizens’ awareness, both in quantitative and in qualitative
terms. In this context, the level of comprehensibility of information
made available to citizens by the public administration should also
be taken into account. Only if citizens fully comprehend
information that is provided to them proactively can it be
considered that citizens have been properly informed. Reformatting
of the information booklets would entail changes in the data entry
and updating arrangements, which in turn would have direct effects
on citizens’ awareness and facilitate the work of civil servants and
oversight of compliance with the Law.
If adopted, this measure would ensure the following:
- Public administration bodies would be able to prepare their
Information Booklets in a more efficient and faster manner
because they would be prepared exclusively electronically;
- Information booklets would contain absolutely all data specified
by the law, i.e. there would be no incomplete information booklets
– the application would not be able to close if all specified data
have not been entered;
- The number of freedom of information requests would be reduced
because all pieces of information would be available in a single
central database and because expanding the circle of persons
subject to the duty to apply the law would have impact on the
availability and quality of published information;
- Public administration would be significantly improved because all
pieces of information would be available in a single central
database, both for other authorities and for citizens;
- Updating of data in information booklets would be improved
because of the duty to register changes within a much shorter time
limit;
- The system used for overseeing compliance with the Law on Free
Access to Information of Public Importance would be more
efficient because oversight procedures would be more expedient
and the oversight activities would be conducted to a higher
standard of quality;
- Interested parties would have easier and faster access to the
required information, which they would be able to download in an
open format, compare, cross-check and use for further analysis,
research and development of various applications;
- Civic participation would improve significantly, as would the
watchdog role of the media and citizens’ oversight of the work of
public authorities.
The way in which this
commitment is relevant to
further advancing OGP values
The proactive transparency principle is fully compliant with the
open government principles, which are also proclaimed by the OGP
initiative. Timely provision of information in an open format would
directly improve data accessibility, which will ensure transparency
and accountability in the work of public administration and foster
civic participation and influence on the work of public
administration.
Provision of information in an open data format would enable
subsequent processing of information and easier development of
services and digital solutions for certain social services or social
changes (e.g. development of a web or mobile application which 
48
would provide necessary information on required documentation to
citizens.

Description of Commitment
Problem addressed by the
commitment
The Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance is
currently being revised. The current revision aims to address
certain deficiencies that have been observed in the
implementation of the Law in practice.
The Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance
dates back to 2004. The Law has been praised as excellent in
terms of its legislative arrangements, but its implementation in
practice has revealed certain deficiencies. It has been observed
in practice that there is a need to develop the Law in other
directions as well, since certain issues are not properly regulated 
50
or are not regulated at all. This includes in particular the issue of
proactive publishing of information by the authorities on their
websites, improving and increasing the transparency of data
published in the information booklets, expanding the scope of
persons subject to the law, clarifying the procedure for
appointment and removal from office, administrative
enforcement and other amendments which would
comprehensively regulate the application of the right to access
information of public importantce.
The Commissioner for Information of Public Importance
received a similar number of complaints in 2016 and 2017 –
about 3,500 – mostly in cases of the so-called administrative
silence. This shows that the legal enforcement mechanisms
cannot be fully implemented in practice.
However, the last two years saw progress in this regard, with the
institution of infringement proceedings against a number of
entities.
The Special Working Group on preparation of the Draft Law
Amending the Law on Free Access to Information of Public
Importance was formed on 3 November 2016, and many
meetings have been held with the competent authorities, as well
as with representatives of the Commissioner’s Office, at which
the Draft Law was endorsed. In compliance with the proclaimed
principles of transparency in the passing of regulations and
involvement of the non-governmental sector in the process, a
public consultation was held from 5 and 15 February 2018,
where representatives of the public and civil sectors made more
than 100 suggestions and proposals. A public debate was held
from 22 March to 19 April 2018. It included a Round Table
held on 27 March, which was attended, in addition to the
members of the Special Working Group, also by representatives
of state authorities, economic operators, academia and
professional associations, eminent experts in this field and
representatives of more than 30 civil society organisations.
Many suggestions and proposals were received, and it was
determined upon analysis that they can be grouped around a
certain number of Articles and proposed provisions. Taking into
account the importance of this law in the coming years, all
these comments will be discussed in great detail through written
or direct communication with the participants in the public
debate and the Draft Law will be finished and submitted to the
competent authorities for opinion and then presented to the
Government for adoption.
Main objective The Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance
must be amended to ensure respect of the right to access
information and compliance with time limits set by the law. The
duty to proactively publish information shold also be
established.
The future Law on Free Access to Information of Public
Importance must include the following provisions:
1. 1. To ensure efficient oversight of lawfulness of operations of
public administration bodies and other entities subject to
administrative oversight and inspection for violations of the 
51
right of access to information of public importance, in
compliance with the principle of independence of oversight
authorities and the principles of good governance;
2. 2. To expand the circle of authorites/persons subject to the law,
both newly founded and existing which have not been subject to
the law so far although their sphere of competences requires so;
3. 3. To reduce reasons for rejecting requests because of abuse of
rights specified in the Law, such as frequent submission of
requests and volume of information;
4. 4. To improve the selection procedure and termination of office
of the Commissioner, the position of the Deputy Commisisoner
and the Commissioner’s Office;
5. To introduce the obligation to obtain an opinion of the
Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and
Personal Data Protection in the process of passing laws, to the
extent that those regulations fall within the remit of this
authority;
6. To improve the situation regarding enforcement of decisions
passed by the Commissioner for Information of Public
Importance and Personal Data Protection;
7. To bring the amount of fines in compliance with the Law on
Misdemeanours and to establish a protective mechanism to
ensure the achieved level of freedom of information cannot be
reduced by other regulations;
8. To impose a duty on the authorities subject to this Law to
proactively publish information of public importance
How will this commitment
contribute to problem solving?
Amendments to the Law on Free Access to Information of
Public Importance would address the issues which arose in the
implementation of this Law in practice. Proper oversight of
implementation of the Law and of the institute of enforcement
of the Commissioner’s decisions would improve the exercise of
the right of access to information and would raise awareness of
the importance of this right among the entities subject to this
Law. In addition, amendments to the Law which would vest the
Commissioner with the power to give opinions in the process of
enactment of laws would ensure that the existing level of
protection of rights is not reduced by other laws and regulations.
Amendments to the Law regarding proactive publishing of
information would help reduce the number of appeals filed to
the Commissioner due to violations of the right to free access to
information of public interest, and improve respect for the right
of access to information, which is also enshrined in the
Constitution.
The way in which this commitment
is relevant to further advancing
OGP values
Improvement in the access to information of public importance
through amendments of the Law will ensure a higher level of
freedom of information, which is also one of the core values of
the Partnership. Also, genuine advocacy of improved public
administration and fight against corruption must entail
transparency in the work of public authorities. The above 
52
amendments to the Law would ensure that these issues are
properly addressed.

RS0046,Serbia,4,4,SRB,Europe,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Improve the mechanisms for public involvement in the management processes of protected areas on the territory of the Republic of Serbia,Draft law on public participation in environmental protection,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Article 67 of the current Law on Environmental Protection (“Official Gazette of RS”, No. 36/09, 88/10, 91/10 - corr., 14/16 and 95/18 - other law) stipulates that a ""legal entity that meets the professional, personnel and organizational requirements for the performance of activities of preservation, improvement, promotion of natural and other values and the sustainable use of the protected area"" can run the protected area, in the capacity of a manager. The same article further stipulates that exceptionally ""the manager may be an entrepreneur and/or a natural person if it is a protected area of a small surface and a majorly private ownership in real estate"", and that ""the body responsible for issuing the proclamation act may establish a public enterprise, public institution or company for the purposes of managing one or more protected areas.” In addition to other obligations prescribed by the law, the manager of the protected area is obliged to adopt a management plan for the protected area, on whose proposal they are obliged to obtain the consent of the competent state body, as well as to inform the public about this proposal through public inspection lasting for 30 days, in accordance with Article 54 of the Law. Considering that public companies consist the majority of managers of protected areas in Serbia (PC Srbijašume manages 50.07% of the total area of protected areas, and PC Vojvodinašume is the manager of 17 protected areas), and the increasing pressure from the tourism, agriculture, energy and transport sectors in practice, it is necessary to increase the transparency of the work of public companies that are managers of protected areas, i.e. to improve the existing ways and opportunities for the participation of the local population in the management of these areas. 

What is the commitment? The commitment implies the adoption of a new Law on Environmental Protection, which will introduce new mechanisms for public participation in the management of protected areas and improve opportunities for participation of local people in this process. More precisely, the new law will introduce two new mechanisms: - mandatory public debates for all protected areas in the process of developing management plans, which will further strengthen the existing mechanism of public inspection, - the obligation to form a Beneficiary Council for all protected areas, which would include representatives of local CSOs, by analogy with the solution provided for national parks in the relevant sector regulation. 33 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? The envisioned amendments to the Law on Environmental Protection will enable a significantly higher degree of influence of citizens, primarily the local population, in the management of protected areas. At the same time, this encourages a more active role of the public in the management of protected areas in which they live, and allows them to directly participate in giving recommendations and suggestions, but also in the implementation of protection measures. Overall, the management of protected areas will become more transparent with the implementation of this commitment, while the added value is the improvement of trust between the local population and the managers of protected areas, which is of special importance in these processes. 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? The commitmentis primarily relevant in relation to public participation as a value of the OGP, bearing in mind that it improves the mechanisms for citizen participation in a specific area, such as the management of public protected areas. Also, the relevance from the aspect of OGP exists in relation to transparency, because the implementation of the commitmentwill improve access to information that is important for the management of protected areas. Finally, the commitmentwill also influence managers, primarily public companies entrusted with the management of protected areas, to be more responsible in fulfilling their legal obligations.

RS0047,Serbia,4,5,SRB,Europe,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Development of e-service for citizens – submitting requests and receiving decisions on changes in the voter register,Establish electronic service for citizens to update voter register,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? According to the current regulations, citizens submit a request for a change in the Unified Voters' List to the competent municipal or city administration according to the place of residence, i.e. the ministry in charge of administrative affairs when it is responsible for changes in the voter register (from the conclusion of the voter register to 72 hours before election day), by regular mail or in person, at the office of the competent authority. On the other hand, decisions on changes in the voter register are delivered to citizens in the same ways, i.e. by regular mail or in person. Such ways of submitting requests and receiving decisions on changes in the voter register need to be made more efficient, faster and more modern, while spending as little time and resources as possible for citizens. 

What is the commitment? The commitment implies the establishment of a new eService that will enable all registered users of the eGovernment Portal to submit a request for a change in the voter register to the competent authority through their user account, as well as to be provided with a decision on changes in the voter register. 35 The realization of this commitment will significantly improve the existing way of performing these activities, with significantly less time and resources, both for citizens and the administration. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? The first step in the implementation of this commitment implies the adoption of the Law on Amendments to the Law on the Seal of State and Other Bodies, which will introduce the electronic seal of the MPALSG, as well as the local self-government units entrusted with updating the voter list. This will enable them to make decisions in the form of an electronic document in the system of the Unified Voters' List in accordance with the provisions of the Law on Electronic Document, Electronic Identification and Trust Services in Electronic Business (""Official Gazette of RS"", No. 94/17). The next step involves connecting the eGovernment Portal and the Unified Voters' List system, in order to create a link between these two systems and enable citizens to submit requests for changes in the voter list through orders on this portal, i.e. submitting decisions on changes in the same way, via an email service. In this way, the improvement of citizens' rights, that is an easier, more efficient and faster realization of citizens' rights will be ensured, as well as the efficiency and economy of the procedure, because the citizen will be electronically informed about the status of the submitted request for a change in the voter register. 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? The commitment is relevant in relation to public accountability given that it encompasses the efforts of public authorities towards more efficient provision of public services to citizens. Also, the its implementation contributes to more efficient management of an accurate and complete voter list by the competent state bodies, at the same time showing the existence of awareness and responsibility for its accurate and timely updating. Bearing in mind that the implementation of the commitment will enable the electronic provision of services by the competent authorities through the eGovernment Portal, the commitment is also relevant in relation to the use of innovations and technologies. Finally, the commitment also contains elements of citizen participation, given that registration for the voter register with accurate data is a prerequisite for citizen participation in the electoral processes, and the implementation of this obligation improves the existing mechanisms for fulfilling this condition.

RS0048,Serbia,4,6,SRB,Europe,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Improving the quality of public service delivery through the establishment of a single public register of administrative procedures and a single platform with all information on procedures / services – ePAPER,Create register with information on all administrative procedures/services for citizens,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Citizens and the economy face high costs of providing services and often complicated procedures in exercising their rights and fulfilling their obligations to public administration bodies, as well as problems in finding all the information needed to perform certain procedures smoothly, leading to less legal safety through poor predictability of business conditions, insufficient information about changes, and high administrative costs of business, which especially affects the economy. 

What is the commitment? Improving the quality of public service delivery is a multi-year reform process that takes place, among other things, through the simplification of administrative procedures (the elimination of redundancy and the simplification of other administrative procedures), as well as the establishment of a single public register of administrative procedures and other business conditions (hereinafter: Register) with a portal that provides all the necessary information. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? The register will be a publicly available electronic database of all administrative procedures and other business conditions conducted by public administration bodies and organizations. Business entities and citizens will receive all the necessary information for the implementation of a specific procedure in one place through the Register Portal: whether there is a form for submitting a request (to download it); to which the request is submitted and whether there is a possibility to submit it electronically; what other documentation is needed, in what form and whether it is necessary to finish something beforehand (notarization, etc.); what are the financial expenses (fees, charges, etc.); what is the deadline for resolving the request; the time of validity of the issued act and the envisioned right to appeal. Such publicly available information will save the resources of economic entities and enable them to dedicate more time to performing their own activities. It will provide legal safety for citizens and certitude in proceedings before public administration branches. The simplification of procedures will lead to a reduction of the administrative burden, by removing obstacles to the simple fulfillment of the obligations of economic entities and citizens. In the previous period, efforts were focused on the list of 2,600 procedures related to economic entities, and their optimization and digitalization is currently underway. In the following period, the cycle count, optimization and digitalization of administrative procedures related to citizens will be conducted, and a publicly accessible register with a portal containing all the necessary information on the procedures conducted before public administration bodies and organizations will be established. 38 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? The introduction of the register and portal will contribute to: increasing transparency in the conduct of public administration, reducing the possibility of abuse and corruption, raising the level of public accountability, public availability of all relevant information for action, as well as facilitating daily business operations and exercising citizens' rights and obligations. 

Additional information The commitment is recognized as one of the Government’s main priorities, and is defined in numerous public policy documents: Program for simplification of administrative procedures and regulations ""ePapir"" for 2019-2021; eGovernment development program for 2020-2022; Public Administration Reform Strategy in the Republic of Serbia for 2021-2030 (under preparation).

RS0050,Serbia,4,8,SRB,Europe,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Amendment of the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance,Amend existing right to information legislation,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? The Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance was adopted in 2004 and amended in 2007, 2009 and 2010, with amendments aimed at improving the text in order to improve implementation or to balance the text with the changes in other regulations in the legal system, for example in connection with the execution of the Commissioner's decisions, changes in the competent ministry for supervision (due to changes in the Law on Ministries), and changes in penal provisions. And if the Law is rated as one of the best in the world in this area by eminent international NGOs, practice has shown that there exists a need to further improve the Law to ensure its full implementation in practice including strengthening the Office of the Commissioner, as we are keeping pace with the principles of Open Administration, in accordance with the new regulations (new LAP, protection of personal data, etc.). One of the most important issues is the proactive publication of information by the authorities in the newsletter, but also the expansion of Contact Information Name of responsible person from implementing agency Mihailo Jovanović Title, Department Director Email and phone mihailo.jovanovic@ite.gov.rs Other Actors Involved State actors involved Government Working Group for Peer Violence CSOs, private sector, multilaterals, working groups Association of Lawyers AEPA 44 the circle of persons covered by the Law, specifying the procedure for election and dismissal of the Commissioner, improving the enforcement of commissioner's decisions, increasing penalties with a law relevant to improving the exercise of the right of access to information of public importance. The Commissioner for Information of Public Importance received a similar number of complaints in 2016, 2017 and 2018, amounting to about 3,500, while during 2019 there was a noticeable increase in the number of complaints filed. The reasons presented in the complaints mostly refer to the cases of the so-called silence by the management, but also submission of a negative answer, without issuing a decision with the reasons for rejecting the request and a lesson on the legal remedy. High percentage of well-founded complaints (above 85%), but also a large percentage of suspended proceedings (over 50%) after the authorities act upon the request of the applicant in the meantime, after learning about the complaint and the required statement by the Commissioner, and before making a decision on the complaint, indicate that the changes in the legal framework make it necessary to influence the administrative bodies to better and more promptly perform their legal obligations. A special working group for the preparation of the text of the Draft Law on Amendments to the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance was formed, by the decision of the Minister of State Administration and Local Self-Government, on November 3, 2016. In accordance with the proclaimed principles of transparency in the adoption of regulations and the involvement of the non-governmental sector, the professional public and independent bodies, the Working Group prepared a Draft Law on Amendments to the Law. Cooperation with the Commissioner, meetings with representatives of state bodies, independent bodies, and civil society speak in favor of a transparent and inclusive process. On the working version of the Draft Law on Amendments, public online consultations were held from February 5 to February 15, 2018, which collected over 100 suggestions and proposals by the public and civil sector representatives. Taking into account the received suggestions, the Working Group finalized the Draft Law, after which a public debate was held, from March 22 to April 19, 2018, and within it a Round Table on March 27, where, in addition to members of the Special Working Group, representatives of state bodies, business entities, academia, professional associations, eminent experts in this field, as well as representatives of more than 30 civil society organizations were present. Comparing the number of obligations received on certain proposed solutions and the importance of the issues they regulate, the Ministry did not send the Law to the competent authorities to give their opinions and to the Government to determine the proposal immediately after the public hearing, but rather decided to 45 organize a new round of meetings with activity holders, and together they came up with the best solutions. In the rules of procedure for collecting the opinions of the competent institutions, the text of the Draft Law, given the importance of the area it regulates, was sent to a wide range of state bodies and institutions (a total of 26). The Ministry received all opinions of competent bodies and institutions by April 2019, including the opinion of the European Commission (prepared by SIGMA for the needs of the EC on December 19, 2018). The new Commissioner, Mr. Milan Marinović, was elected in July 2019 and the Ministry of State Administration and Local Self-Government left room to comment on the Draft Law, and the new Commissioner sent new proposals in September that were not subject to previous changes, for which reason the procedure is ongoing. 

What is the commitment? It is necessary to amend the Law on Free Access to Information in order to ensure the improvement of respect for the right to access information, as well as the deadlines prescribed by law. At the same time, the obligation to proactively publish information should be improved – through an electronic Information Booklet. The following provisions need to be included in the future Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance: 1. Ensure effective control of the legality of the work of state administration bodies and other subjects of administrative-inspection supervision due to violation of the right to access information of public importance, while respecting the principle of independence of the control body and the principle of good administration; 2. Increase the circle of bodies/persons to which the application of the law applies, both to the newly established ones and to some that have not been covered so far and whose scope requires it; 3. Reduce the number of reasons for rejecting requests due to abuse of rights stated in the Law, such as frequent submission of requests and scope of information; 4. Improve the procedure for the election and termination of the Commissioner’s mandate, the position of the Deputy Commissioner and the Office of the Commissioner; 5. Determine the whether or not it is mandatory to obtain the opinion of the Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection in the process of passing the law if the act contains issues within the scope of this body; 6. Improve the situation in the field of enforcing the Commissioner’s decisions for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection; 46 7. Balance the severity of fines with the Law on Misdemeanors and establish a protective mechanism so that the realized level of the right to access information could not be reduced by other regulations; 8. Establish the obligation of the bodies that are obliged by this Law, to proactively publish information of public importance through the introduction of an electronic Fact Sheet and a single portal that would ensure better implementation. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? Amendments to the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance would improve the proactive publication of information of public importance through the introduction of an electronic fact sheet aimed at proactive, timely, complete, uniform publication of information by public authorities. One of the most important amendments to the law envisions the expansion of the circle of persons who are legally obligated to natural persons as executors of public authorities and city municipalities, as well as the introduction of full application of all legal obligations to all persons covered by this law which will, together with the introduction of an electronic fact sheet, contribute to more transparent work of public authorities and the consequent reduction of complaints to the Commissioner for the violation of the right to access information of public importance and at the same time increase respect for the right to access information, which also represents a constitutional category. Adequate supervision over the application of the Law and the application of the institute of enforcement of the Commissioner's decisions would facilitate the exercise of the right to access information. Also, amendments to the Law, in the direction of giving the Commissioner the authority to give an opinion within the law-making process, would prevent the possible reduction of the existing level of exercise and protection of the right to free access in other/special laws. The current weak efficiency of penalties for non-compliance with the law will be solved by doubling the range of fines (from 5,000-50,000 to 10,000- 100,000 dinars), which will provide higher prevention and a more effective purpose of punishment. 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? Improving access to information of public importance by amending the Law enables raising the level of exercising freedom of access to information, which is also one of the basic values of the Partnership. Also, a true commitment to better public administration and the fight against corruption necessarily implies transparent work of government bodies. It is precisely through the mentioned amendments to the Law that it would be possible to adequately resolve these issues.

RS0051,Serbia,4,9,SRB,Europe,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,"Creating legal bases for the establishment of a central web portal displaying all procedures for environmental impact assessment, as well as procedures for strategic environmental impact assessment at the national, provincial and local levels",Amend legislation to establish enviromental impact assessment portal,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? According to Article 29 of the Law on Environmental Impact Assessment (""Official Gazette of RS"", No. 135/04 and 36/09), which regulates the manner of informing the public, it is the competent authority’s obligation to inform the public about the request submitted issuing a decision on the need for influence assessment, then on the time and place of public insight, as well as the decision to give consent, i.e. rejection of the request, through at least one local newspaper, with the possibility of sending the mentioned notifications through electronic media. A similar solution exists when it comes to informing the public about the insight into the documents that are an integral part of the strategic impact assessment, and about which the public is informed through the media, but also in electronic form available on the website of the local government unit. The practice so far has shown the need to further improve these mechanisms, i.e. to make informing the public, and thus the opportunities for greater participation of citizens in these processes, more accessible and efficient. The previous need arises primarily from the fact that, for example, selected local newspapers do not always have to be the main sources of information for the local population, and such information can go unnoticed or can be obtained when it is too late to respond in a timely manner. Given the overall complexity of the impact assessment process and strategic environmental assessment, including the complex competencies of state bodies, it is very important to improve the availability of information on these procedures to the members of the interested public, as it is difficult for citizens to understand which body to address, and where information on the appropriate procedure has been published, making their participation more difficult. Also, in the existing conditions, in which the public is informed in the stated ways, it is difficult to compare and monitor several projects, including a review of completed public debates, data and the like. These problems could be overcome by forming a single database of all assessments and of the strategic assessments of the impact on the environment in the Republic of Serbia, which would ensure that all information on the course and stages of the procedure is available in one place and thus enable greater public participation, but also a more transparent procedure. What is the commitment? The commitment implies creating legal bases for the establishment of a central web portal with all procedures for environmental impact assessment and all procedures for strategic environmental impact assessment at the national, provincial and local levels. More precisely, the implementation of the commitment will make the necessary amendments to two key regulations in this area – the Law on Environmental Impact Assessment and the Law on Strategic Environmental Assessment – which will provide for the establishment of this web portal as a searchable 49 database of all impact assessments and strategic environmental impact assessments. Creating legal bases is a necessary step towards the development of a web portal meant to make its use an obligation of the competent authorities, and in practice the portal has become a unique place for informing and involving the public in impact assessment and strategic environmental assessment procedures. In addition to the obligation to create a web portal, the amendments to the said laws will specify the period of two years starting from the moment when the law enters into force, in which it will become functional and enter into full use. How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? The establishment and mandatory use of a central web portal will make all information on environmental impact assessment and strategic environmental assessment procedures available in one place. In that way, the interested members of the public will be able to get information about these procedures faster and easier, but also to participate in them. More precisely, through this portal, the competent authorities will inform the interested bodies and organizations, the public and the interested members of the public about all initiated impact assessment procedures and strategic impact assessments, the course of procedures, deadlines and ways of submitting opinions, public debates and direct access to documentation in accordance with law. Also, all interested members of the public will have the opportunity to gain insight and search the mentioned impact assessments in one place, which has not been the case thus far, laying the groundwork for further analytical processing by the professional public. In order to realize the above-mentioned goals and thus ensure uniformity in the use of the central web portal and join the implementation of impact assessment and strategic impact assessment and public participation in them, changes in the existing regulations provided by this obligation are necessary. Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? The commitment is relevant in relation to public participation, as it implies the development and improvement of existing mechanisms for the participation of the interested public and the procedures of impact assessment and strategic environmental impact assessment. Also, the commitment is relevant in relation to access to information, because the amendments to key laws lay the foundations for binding and uniform public information, in one place, for all procedures in the Republic of Serbia. Additional information Amendments to the Law on Environmental Impact Assessment and the Law on Strategic Environmental Assessment are envisioned by the National Program for the Adoption of the Acquis. 50 Milestone Activity with a verifiable deliverable Start date: End date: 1.

RS0053,Serbia,4,11,SRB,Europe,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Development of a single information platform for monitoring project co-financing in the field of public information,Develop platform for monitoring implementation of public calls,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Public calls for co-financing the production of media content are the main way of allocating and spending budget funds in the media sector. They have been established as a state aid mechanism to help produce missing content of public interest and improve the degree in which citizens are informed. 55 The analysis of the current practice of conducting public calls has shown numerous problems, and one of the most serious objections by civil society and media associations referred to the impossibility of a comprehensive analysis of the effects of of these calls (intended use of funds, quality of production content, etc.). Evaluation is largely hindered by the lack of centralized, publicly available data and documentation related to public calls (project applications and reports), as well as access to the produced content. This problem is also recognized in the Strategy for the Development of the Public Information System in the Republic of Serbia from 2020 to 2025, in item 4.4. The way to solve this problem is developmentof a single information platform, which would facilitate the search for announced calls, projects, decisions made on announced calls, submitted financial and narrative reports on realized projects, and contain links to broadcast or published media content for which the production is supported in this way. Based on the data entered in the single information platform, it would be easier to apply legal provisions prohibiting the financing of the same projects from different levels of government over a certain percentage, but also the availability of media content co-financed in this way to all citizens, in areas wider than those in which certain media are distributed. A single information platform would additionally enable greater publicity of data, bearing in mind that all relevant information would be available to all citizens of the Republic of Serbia. 

What is the commitment? The commitment includes: ● Analysis of the regulatory framework and comparative practices in the application of information platforms for monitoring the implementation of public calls, with a technical specification for its development; ● Amendments to the Law on Public Information and Media which would make the use of the platform a legal obligation for all bodies that announce and conduct public calls in this area and regulate its content and manner of functioning; ● Formation and technical development of the information platform. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? The development of an information platform within this obligation will contribute to solving several problems: it will centralize all relevant data and thus facilitate the monitoring of public calls and their evaluation, facilitate and significantly improve the monitoring of budget spending, prevent possible abuses and enable greater availability of media funds. 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? The commitment will contribute to the improvement of several core values of the OGP. First of all, the commitmentis relevant in relation to the improvement of fiscal transparency, given that its implementation enables public 56 availability of data on the spending of budget funds intended for cofinancing media content. At the same time, it is relevant from the aspect of improving access to information, because through the information platform covered by the commitment, a much larger set of information and data on how to spend budget funds in the field of media content will be made available. In addition, this data will be centralized and available in one place, which will provide citizens and all other interested parties with easy access. The commitment is also relevant in relation to the improvement of the accountability of public authorities, since it implies the creation of clear rules for publishing data on budget spending through changes in the legal framework, but also the creation of conditions for more efficient oversight of law enforcement. Finally, bearing in mind that the commitment implies the development of an appropriate information platform, it is directly related to the use of technologies and innovations as a special value of OGP. 

Additional information The commitment directly addresses the problem identified in item 4.4. of the Strategies for the development of public information in the Republic of Serbia between 2020 and 2025.

RS0054,Serbia,4,12,SRB,Europe,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Introduction of the obligation to conduct a public debate when determining topics important for the realization of public interest in the territory for which a public call is announced in the field of public information,Conduct public debate regarding topics of public interest,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? The Law on Public Information and Media determines the basic criteria for the evaluation of projects submitted in the announced public calls for co-financing media content from budget funds, and also prescribes that more detailed criteria are published within each public call. In accordance with that, among other things, public calls, as a rule, contain topics that are of primary importance in the period of announcing a certain call, as well as in a certain geographical area for which the call is announced. However, in practice, such legal solutions have led to the fact that bodies that allocate budget funds either just take over the definition of public interest from the Law, without prioritizing certain topics, or arbitrarily set priorities without prior consultation with citizens of the community in whose area the public interest is realized through supported media content. In that way, citizens remain deprived of the opportunity to express their needs in relation to the desired media content, but also the chance to participate in some way in the decision-making process on the manner in which budget funds are spent. In that sense, the Strategy for the Development of the Public Information System in the Republic of Serbia between 2020 and 2025 envisages that ""amendments to the law in the field of public information, as well as the 58 accompanying bylaw will prescribe, as an additional criterion in project co-financing competitions, the results of public hearings on which citizens expressed their opinion on topics and media content in order to achieve the public interest of citizens in the territory for which the competition was announced ”(measure 4.4., activity 4.4.1). 

What is the commitment? The commitment includes amendments to the Law on Public Information and Media and the accompanying bylaw, in the direction of introducing the obligation of public authorities which conduct calls in the field of public information, to organize a public debate before announcing topics important for achieving public interest in the field of public information on the territory for which the competition is announced. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? By introducing the obligation to conduct public debates in order to define priority topics for achieving public interest through media content, citizens are given the opportunity to express their needs and point out particularly important topics for the community in which they live, which should be supported by budget funds. Also, in this way, they are given the opportunity to participate in the process of deciding on the spending of budget funds through participation in public debates. Overall, involving the community in the process of defining priority topics of public interest in its area ensures that supported media content responds to the needs of the citizens who make up that community. 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? On the one hand, the commitment is relevant in relation to fiscal transparency, given that its implementation provides a better insight into the spending of budget funds by citizens. Also, the commitment contributes to improving the participation of citizens in decision-making processes, bearing in mind that, through public debates on particularly important topics for the realization of public interest, citizens are given the opportunity to participate in some way in the decision-making process regarding the use of budget funds. 

Additional information The commitment is directly related to measure 4.4. of the Strategies for the development of the public information system in the Republic of Serbia for from 2020 to 2025.

SL0029,Sierra Leone,3,8,SLE,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2019,2021,2,NA,Records and Archives Management,Records and Archives Management,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address?
The Public Archives Act is an essential step in
ensuring effective implementation of the Right to
Access Information Act. Without proper records
management systems of key government
documents, they cannot be publicly disclosed. The
critical lack of records has hampered the fight
against corruption and achievement of international
benchmarks, such as attainment of the Sustainable
Development Goals.

What is the commitment? 
This commitment is geared towards ensuring that
Sierra Leone has a law on Archives and Records
management which will support the implementation
of the Right to Access Information.

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem?
Effective records management is also important for
accountable and transparent operation of public
institutions. To complete the passage of the
National Records and Archives Bill and to
harmonize policies and procedures for managing
digital records with the Right to Access Information
law and the open data portal.
This commitment will support the implementation of
the Right to Access Information Act in a bid to
improve public transparency. It will also support the
fight against corruption by:
 Increasing public integrity;
 Improving the effective management of public
resources; and
 Using innovation and technology.
Why is this commitment
relevant to OGP values
Access to information: The passing of the
Archives and Records Management Law will
support the implementation of the right to access
information law.
Public Accountability: When there is a law that
makes it mandatory for public officials to keep public
documents, citizen will use it to hold public officials
accountable especially when the records relate to
service delivery.Technology and innovation: The assessment of
digital records in the government agencies to
determine what exists and to develop structures for
coordinating, capturing, preserving and sharing
these records will set the pace for accessing digital
records.

Additional Information:
The Right to Access Information Act was passed in
October 2013 and the Right to Access Information
Commission (RAIC) was set up in 2014.
Efforts were made to pass the Records and
Archives Management Bill in 2016 and 2017, but it
was stalled along the way before being tabled in

SL0033,Sierra Leone,4,4,SLE,Africa and the Middle East,National,1,2021,2023,2,NA,Open Extractives/BO & Systematic Disclosures of Extractives Data,Extractives and Beneficial Ownership Data Disclosure,"What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Sierra Leone is endowed with rich natural resources contributing up to 67% of total exports. Given that natural resources played a significant role in sustaining conflict during the Sierra Leone Civil War (1991-2002), the transparent management of these resources remains a national priority. The Government of Sierra Leone first announced its intention to join the EITI in June 2006 to promote transparency and accountability in the management of its natural resources. Ever since, SLEITI has made steady progress, producing 10 EITI reports covering the period 2006 to 2019 and achieving the global body’s ‘meaningful progress’ status following its last Validation in 2018. While progress has been made to improve reporting and transparency in the extractive sector, opportunities remain to promote routine disclosure and accountability for i) revenues derived from natural resources extraction and production, ii) the ultimate beneficial owners of companies engaged in extractive projects iii) contracts entered into between government and companies and revenues accrued to subnational entities. Additionally, SLEITI reports contain critical information and data about how the extractives sector is managed, but the reports are not adequately utilized by the public, and their findings and recommendations are often not fully implemented by the relevant government agencies and companies. By implication, these pose several problems including inadequate public engagement in the affairs of the sector, and lack of optimization of the benefits that can accrue to the government and the citizens. To ensure that transparency is an integral and systematic part of extractive sector management, EITI implementing countries including Sierra Leona are increasingly making more information available online through systematic disclosures. Disclosing data at source; through government and corporate databases, online registries, websites, and portals can provide citizens and stakeholders with accessible and up to date information on the sector. 

What is the commitment? This commitment is about working together with all relevant agencies and stakeholders to enhance transparency in the extractives sector through a concrete set of systematic disclosures of data related to extractives sector management including the legal frameworks, licenses, contracts, beneficial ownership of companies, exploration, production, and export, and payments by companies and receipts by governments on all transactions across the sector’s value chain. Disclosing EITI data at source through government and corporate databases, online registries, websites and portals can provide citizens and stakeholders with accessible and up to date information on the sector. Like other requirements, beneficial ownership disclosure is a major government commitment to be followed through owing to H.E. President Maada Bio’s pronouncement at the EITI Beneficial Ownership Conference in Dakar in 2018. With this commitment in place, EITI reporting in Sierra Leone becomes simpler, timelier, and more costeffective, in addition to disclosing beneficial owners of corporate entities. It would help stakeholders to shift their focus from collecting data to using data. Extractive sector stakeholders would be better placed to analyze and present findings for public debate and reform. For companies, disclosing data at source would help them to build trust by improving their ‘social license to operate’ and help set the right expectations with communities and citizens in their areas of operation. 

How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? Evidence suggests that citizenry engagement in transparent and accountable governance have positive impact on social trust, corporate integrity and efficient management of government revenue. This in turn contributes to inclusive economic growth and peaceful societies. Systematic disclosure of extractives sector data will enhance increased public access to and use of information from the sector. When citizens are empowered with information, it is expected that it would lead to increased public debate about how the sector is managed. In addition, a more open extractive sector would create a level playing field and send positive signals to genuine investors about doing business in the Sierra Leone. SLEITI and OGP will work with all relevant agencies to clearly specify information/data that should be routinely disclosed and how best they should be disclosed. SLEITI and OGP will also work to encourage civil society and accountability actors to improve their engagement and use of systematically disclosed data. 

Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? The commitment is targeted at enhancing citizens’ engagement in the extractives sector by increasing access to essential data on extractive sector management. A more transparent extractive industry will help to increase corporate and government accountability, increasing public integrity and trust, ensure effective management of public resources by government and ultimately, create safer communities for the citizens to live and work in.

This commitment seeks to promote open and accountable management of mineral resources through a multi-stakeholder approach. This commitment will further ensure that all relevant agencies and stakeholders work together to enhance and sustain transparency and accountability in the extractives sector through a concrete set of systematic disclosures of data related to extractives sector management, including the legal frameworks, licenses, contracts, beneficial ownership of companies, exploration, production, and export, receipts by government, community payments, and on all transactions across the extractive sector’s value chain.

Problem definition 

What problem does the commitment aim to address? EITI-implementing countries, including Sierra Leona, are increasingly making more information available online through systematic disclosures to ensure that transparency is an integral and systematic part of extractive sector management. Disclosing data at source through government and corporate databases, online registries, websites, and portals can provide citizens and stakeholders with accessible and up-to-date information on the sector. Arguably, everyone concerned about transparency and accountability in the sector's governance is more or less affected—specifically, the government, civil society, the media, researchers, and the public. There is a nationwide gap regarding transparency and accountability in the extractive sector. ? Delay or gaps in information leads to suspicion, misunderstanding, and tension between the government and its citizens. The relevant institutions must routinely provide the relevant information to citizens to be timely, up-to-date, and relevant to its users. Only when sanctioned by law will access to sector data remain a challenge throughout the year. The sector is buoyant and active, meaning up-to-date information must always be promptly made available to the citizens. From the inception or discovery of minerals, access to information and availability has always been lacking and challenging to get. Arguably, this has been since 1930, when minerals were first discovered, and continues to be a problem. 

What are the causes of the problem? Many stakeholders have suggested that corruption and embezzlement are key factors affecting the sector. Overall, stakeholders have resorted to mainstreaming data and revenue details from the sector to ameliorate the challenges associated with the sector. 

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem? So far, several global initiatives, such as the EITI, Transparency International, the OGP, NRGI, and others, have been established as platforms and resources to fix such issues. The outcome has contributed to the availability of data to some extent, and several countries have signed up for these initiatives, which have also brought alarming awareness. 

2. What solution are you proposing? The development of a sector Bill – Extractive Resource Transparency Act is expected to promote the availability of information on the sector and address other related barriers. The Act will also compel stakeholders to do what is right and abide by best practices regarding the sector's governance.

3. What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? The ideal result would be to have a publicly available national Beneficial Ownership register and have institutions routinely publish timely sector data on their websites and other public platforms that can be easily accessible to the public. The need to build a culture of corporate accountability and transparency is central to national development, and at the same time, the proceeds of the revenues generated from the sector must be utilized judiciously for the good of all citizens rather than just a few.

The commitment aims to establish and empower the Right to Access Information Commission (RAIC) to ensure transparency and accountability within the public sector. This involves implementing mechanisms and processes that facilitate citizens' access to information held by government agencies and public authorities. By promoting a culture of openness and transparency, the commitment seeks to empower citizens to exercise their right to access information, hold public officials accountable, and participate more effectively in democratic processes. Through establishing RAIC and implementing associated initiatives, the commitment aims to strengthen governance practices, foster public trust, and enhance citizen engagement in decision-making processes. 

Problem definition 

What problem does the commitment aim to address? The commitment seeks to address the problem of limited transparency and accountability within the public sector. Government Ministries, departments, and agencies often need to maintain access to information, leading to a lack of transparency in decision-making processes and hindering citizens' ability to hold public officials accountable. This lack of transparency can contribute to corruption, inefficiency, and a lack of trust in government institutions. The establishment of the Right to Access Information Commission (RAIC) and the implementation of its activities will facilitate citizens' access to information. The commitment seeks to address these issues by promoting greater transparency, accountability, and citizen engagement in governance. Restricted access to information hinders the ability of journalists and media outlets to report accurately and hold the government accountable, thus limiting freedom of the press. Transparency and access to information are crucial for the work of civil society organizations, including advocacy, research, and monitoring of government activities. 

What are the causes of the problem? Inadequate or nonexistent legal frameworks for access to information may contribute to the problem. Without clear laws guaranteeing access to information, government agencies may withhold information arbitrarily. Reluctance by public officials to disclose information due to concerns about accountability, political sensitivity, or maintaining control over decision-making processes. Complex bureaucratic procedures for accessing information can act as barriers for citizens, journalists, and civil society organizations. Lengthy and cumbersome processes may deter individuals from seeking information.

Commitment Description 

1. What has been done so far to solve the problem?  Legislative Reforms reforms that aim to codify citizens' rights to access information held by public bodies and outline procedures for requesting and obtaining information.  Establishment of Oversight Bodies tasked with ensuring Compliance with access to information laws and resolving disputes.  Training programs and workshops to improve understanding of legal frameworks and build skills for advocating for transparency. 

What solution are you proposing? Advocate for the enactment or amendment of laws that guarantee the right to access information and establish clear procedures for requesting and obtaining information from government agencies. Adopt open government policies prioritizing transparency, accountability, and citizen engagement in decision-making processes. Invest in capacity-building initiatives to enhance the knowledge and skills of government officials, civil society organizations, and the media on access to information, including legal frameworks, advocacy strategies, and digital literacy. Foster collaboration among government agencies, civil society organizations, the media, and international partners to promote transparency and accountability and share best practices in access to information. 

What results do we want to achieve by implementing this commitment? Implementing access to information commitments aims to increase transparency within government institutions by ensuring that information is readily available to citizens, researchers, journalists, and civil society organizations. Provide citizens with access to information; this will enhance accountability and promote good governance practices. Transparent decision-making processes will enable citizens to hold public officials accountable for their actions. Timely access to information will empower citizens to make informed decisions, participate more effectively in democratic processes, and advocate for their rights and interests. Transparency and accountability fostered by implementing access to information commitments can improve public service delivery, as government agencies are held accountable for their performance and use of resources.

There is also no data on the percentage of judicial decisions being published and there is no control system for tracking how the obligation to publish is being fulfilled. Another area of concern is the inability to carry out publishing in a user-friendly way. It is positive news that the Ministry of Justice has declared its interest to modernize the system of publishing of court decisions by providing appropriate technical support within the existing legislative framework.

The Constitu-tional Committee passes the proposal along with its opinion to the Speaker of the National Council who then schedules the proposal along with the opinion of the Constitutional Committee for the next meeting of the National Council. Members of the National Council vote for the candidate who is then proposed to the president for appointment. This method is not satisfactory because in the end result the nominee is chosen only by political parties and the nominee's selection process is subject to the political struggle.
Therefore, the right to propose candidates based on their professional qualities should be also granted to the representatives of legal professionals (such as the representatives of the professional chambers, the academic community, including prosecutors, and the public defender of rights). This requirement is also apparent from the report of the Venice Commission on European Standards relating to the Independence of the Judicial System, Part II - Prosecution43. In the opinion of the Attorney-General's Office, it is necessary to pay close attention to the circle of persons and entities who should have the right to recommend the candidates for the Attorney-General to the National Council. At the same time, the relevant parliamentary committee should keep the competence to decide which nominees will be submitted to the National Coun-cil for voting, but under strict conditions, so that unfair exclusion cannot occur.

Commitment No. 60: In a participatory manner, conduct an analysis of disciplinary proceedings in prose-cutors' affairs and create draft legislative changes in order to increase the transparency of these discipli-nary proceedings.
The motion to initiate disciplinary proceedings may be filed by the Attorney-General (against any prosecu-tor), the Public Defender of Rights, the Deputy Attorney-General and the respective Regional Prosecutor or District Prosecutor. The decision of the first-instance Disciplinary Commission may be appealed. The appeal is addressed by a five-member second-instance Disciplinary Commission. The final decision issued in disci-plinary proceedings is reviewable by a court.
There are several consequences of the existing legal framework:
 Attorney-General has a particularly strong position and has the power to decide about the ap-pointment, replacement, as well as bias of the members of the Disciplinary Commissions, and is al-so entitled to make a motion to initiate disciplinary proceedings. He is therefore both the proposer and the creator of the body that decides on the proposal.
 Although the Prosecutors' Council proposes the members of the disciplinary commissions, it de-cides only on the principles of filling the disciplinary commissions, the use of substitutes and filling in the database of candidates for the members of the disciplinary commissions and the procedure for the allocation of cases to individual commissions.
 Disciplinary proceedings are formally public, but since the members of the Disciplinary Commis-sions include only prosecutors, this is a closed system without real public control. Such a situation can not only be abused to harass prosecutors but also lead to insufficient (or nonobjective) ac-countability because the guilt is decided by colleagues.
 Laws on prosecution also do not explicitly address who can initiate disciplinary action against the Attorney-General.
It is clear from the Constitutional Court's finding45 that the Prosecutor's Office is a special constitutional body of legal protection for which there is a legitimate requirement for such a legal regulation that will allow public control over the activities of the Prosecutor's Office as well as ""an adequate degree of influ-ence of individual constituents of the state authority in relation to the Prosecutor's Office whose purpose is to ensure the proper realization of its mission consisting of an active, fair and impartial procedure in the protection of the public interest, the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, as well as other rights and legitimately protected interests."" According to the Constitutional Court, the disciplinary liability (re-sponsibility) of prosecutors is an institute whose purpose is mainly to direct the work of the prosecution - which is the competence of the Attorney-General. At the same time, however, the Constitutional Court also found that legislation that allows the National Council or constitutional bodies representing the executive branch to nominate candidates to the Disciplinary Commission ""has a rational basis, pursues legitimate aims, and therefore cannot be regarded as a manifestation of the legislator's willfulness.""

The Constitutional Court of the SR stated47: ""The Prosecutor's Office cannot be understood as a closed and isolated system of authorities, which has no bindings to other public authorities and whose activities cannot be interfered with in any (including legally regulated) way. From the principles of a democratic state, the division of power and checks and balances, there is a legitimate requirement for such a legal regulation, which would allow the exercise of public control over the activity of the prosecutor's office and an adequate degree of influence by the various branches of state authority in relation to the prosecutor's office.

Act no. 52/2018 Coll., amending Act no. 297/2008 Coll. on protection against the legalization of income from criminal activity and on protection against the financing of terrorism and on the amendment and supplementing of certain laws as amended and amending certain laws, transposed the Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on preventing the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, which amends Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council (EU) no. 648/2012 and repeals European Parliament and Council Directive 2005/60/EC and Commission Directive 2006/70/EC. In this context, a general obligation to register beneficial owners was introduced, especially in relation to business entities. However, this regulation does not contain effective mechanisms for ex ante and ex post verification of data on end users of benefits. This legal and factual situation leads to the fact that it is not possible to fully rely on the existing beneficial ownership records. Proper beneficial ownership recordkeeping, especially with regard to the timeliness and completeness of data, is a necessary prerequisite for increasing the transparency of contractual and ownership relationships, improving and making the business environment and economic competition more transparent, and creating an effective obstacle that significantly complicates the abuse of business companies for illegal purposes (money laundering, committing criminal activity, circumventing regulations on conflict of interests or proving the origin of assets, illegal cartel agreements, tax fraud, etc.). Last but not least, it is a prerequisite for public control of the possible abuse of commercial companies for illegal purposes by providing free and online up-to-date, structured and complete data about beneficial ownership to the public, investigative journalists, the third sector and state authorities, from Slovakia as well as from abroad. 

What is the commitment? The commitment ""scales"" the proven principles of verification (ex ante), publication and subsequent control (ex post) of the correctness and completeness of the data on the beneficial owners. Slovakia was one of the first countries in the world, which through its law no. 315/2016 Coll. on the register of public sector partners introduced mandatory registration and verification of beneficial ownership data for persons from the private sector who have public resources or public property at their disposal. This unique system, built on the pillars of (i) public and free online access to data on beneficial ownership, (ii) verification of data on beneficial ownership by the responsible parties who take joint responsibility for the correctness of the data and (iii) reversed burden of proof in case of subsequent judicial review, they also currently represent the highest world standard (the current wording of AML directives 4 and 5 as well as FATF recommendations no. 24 and 25). The planned activity would lead to an appropriate extension of proven principles from persons doing business with the state to all persons registered in the business register (i.e. from approximately 30 thousand entities to approximately 300 thousand entities). The reform of the business register and related IT infrastructure will ensure that all registered entities undergo screening - automated control of recorded data (automated comparison of data with public and private databases) and subsequently entities that show increased risk according to the list of indicators of increased risk (red flags) the so-called ""slow track"" were subject to additional verification of data on the beneficial ownership by a third party. On the contrary, entities that do not show an increased risk would continue in the registration process on the so-called ""fast track"" without unnecessary administrative obstacles (two-track system of ex ante control). In the case of a qualified initiative from the public, the registry court would then examine the correctness of the entry (ex post control), while the principle of transferring the burden of proof to the audited company would be applied. This reform activity will ensure an increase in the transparency of contractual and ownership relations, improvement and transparency of the business environment and economic competition, and will create an effective obstacle that significantly complicates the abuse of business companies for illegal purposes (money laundering, committing criminal activity, circumventing regulations on conflict of interests or proving the origin of assets, illegal cartel agreements, tax fraud, etc.). Last but not least, it will improve public scrutiny of the possible abuse of commercial companies for illegal purposes by providing free and online up-to-date, structured and complete data about beneficial ownership to the public, investigative journalists, the third sector and state authorities, from Slovakia as well as from abroad. 

How will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem? Implementation of the commitment takes place in phases: Phase I: Analysis of the possibilities of the new operation of the business register with regard to the introduction of multi-level verification of data on the beneficial ownership The activity examines how it is possible to achieve that all entities registered in the business register undergo a screening based on automated data control, and subsequently entities that show an increased risk according to the list of indicators of increased risk (""red flags"") would be on the so-called ""slow track"", subject to additional verification of data on the beneficial ownership by a third party. Phase II: Elaboration of a proposal for legislation taking into account the conclusions of the analysis In this phase, the Ministry of Justice will ensure the preparation of legal regulation, which will take into account the results of the analytical phase, in a participatory manner. The draft law will then be submitted to the regular legislative process. Phase III: Implementation of the legislative solution In this phase, the Ministry of Justice will ensure the implementation of the legal solution within the relevant information systems, as well as from an organizational point of view at the level of registry courts (e.g. training).

Commitment Description
What is the public problem that the commitment will address?
Among other factors, limited access to government information greatly hampers the delivery of the right services and interventions that would respond to the real needs of the people. Having access to the right information has a direct and reinforcing relationship in ensuring the delivery of the right interventions and services to the public. For instance, having limited access to the right information from the government, the public tends to get these information from secondary sources that are not always right, hence, they only get to access services or projects that they “think” are only available for them even if these are not relevant to address their real needs. Similarly, many remote communities without access to radio, television, internet or other means of communication have limited knowledge on government data, projects and services that could help empower them to become self-sufficient. Similarly, while the provincial government has the relevant programs and information to bring about lasting results and achieve economic progress to reduce poverty at the household level, the majority of the general public especially those without access to radio, television, internet or other means of communication has limited knowledge of government interventions, and on how these can be accessed and maximized to improve the quality of their lives. In addition, there is also limited formal mechanisms for providing feedback on government services and programs. Currently, the general public is able to access provincial government data by requesting through the Provincial Planning and Development Office (PPDO) or directly through the concerned department or office supported by a written letter of request. For walk-in clients, requests are being recorded though a Logbook. The Socio-economic Profile of the province is also available through a provincial government published book that can be bought at a very affordable price. Due probably to the inconvenience in accessing information and limited knowledge on how to access the information, only 83 formal requests for data were made through the PPDO in a period of five (5) years from 2014 to date where 72 of these or 86% have been provided by the PPDO while the remaining 11 have been referred to appropriate offices. Further, in a rapid survey conducted by the Provincial Information Office during the first quarter of 2018 on Audience Research and Listenership in South Cotabato, about 42% of the 7,252 sample respondents in the entire province (with a projected population of 969,599 in 2018) listen to the radio everyday while about 27% do not own a radio or has no access to other means of communication. Out of the 42% who listen to the radio, almost half or 47.29% are not aware of, hence, are not listening to the provincial government’s radio program where the local government’s programs, projects and services are being broadcasted for public information. About 81% of those who listen to the provincial government’s radio program feel that it is a good source of information about the programs and projects of the province. Among the reports in the radio program, the top 6 information that the respondents find useful are on agriculture, health and sanitation, social services, education and scholarships, barangay/sitio assistance and livelihood programs. It is also useful to note that aside from radio, people get much of their information on government programs and services from other people or through word of mouth (22.53%) and through barangay announcements (22.37%). Ultimately, it is hoped that increased access to government information through both online and offline channels will significantly contribute in further reducing poverty incidence in the province recorded at 19.8% in 2015, especially in the geographically-isolated and disadvantaged communities. 
What is the commitment?
The commitment aims to establish both online and offline channels to expand public access to government information, and to enable citizens to give feedback on government programs and services. More and improved quality of information will be disclosed to include not only those required under the Philippine’s Full Disclosure Policy and basic data on the socio-economic profile of the province, but also information on programs/projects/ services and project monitoring reports. It entails the development of an interactive online platform for the general public to access, view, save and print government data and information on programs and services right at their homes free of charge, with a special feature for the general public to provide their feedback on government services and programs. Part of the commitment includes the conduct of workshop to develop a mechanism for responding to feedbacks from the public. To further utilize the information from the processed feedbacks, the commitment shall be expanded in the second cycle for the feedbacks to inform development planning, budgeting and program implementation. The commitment also entails localizing the national government’s Freedom of Information (FOI) policy through a provincial ordinance, institutionalizing the people’s right to information. 
As an offline mechanism, a direct community participation program shall be launched for communities without access to internet, where the citizens’ questions to the Governor will be recorded during the weekly conduct of the Outreach Program to poor and remote communities where the provincial government brings some of its services directly to the communities, and the Governor’s responses to these questions will be recorded and aired through the province’s official radio program on a weekly basis and on a specified date that will be announced to the community. Capability-building and public engagements shall be conducted to popularize the people’s right to information and how to access these information.
How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem?
The development of the interactive online platform for people to access government information and communicate their feedback/opinion on public services right at their homes, which will be further advanced by the enactment of the FOI ordinance, will provide the people with the right information they need for better decision-making for their economic, social, and institutional development. The commitment will also ensure that the feedback loop is closed by designating a staff who would immediately respond to comments or by coordinating with the appropriate offices in addressing the communicated feedbacks in order to help improve public services and influence government decisions. Further, through public consultations during the regular conduct of the Provincial Outreach Program in the different villages, questions and messages of the citizens especially from remote communities without access to internet shall be recorded and responded to by the Governor through the radio, in addition to posting the responses through South Cotabato’s Facebook Page and the OGP Facebook Page. Increased inclusivity for access to right information will engage and empower people at the grassroots. 
Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values?
Increased inclusivity in public access to government information is relevant to transparency. The commitment shall employ technology through the development of an interactive online system for the public to access information right at their homes.


Additional information
President Rodrigo R. Duterte issued Executive Order No. 02 (series of 2016) or the Freedom of Information Order to institutionalize the people’s right to information as enshrined in Article III of the Philippine Constitution on the Bill of Rights. This operationalizes in the Executive Branch the people’s constitutional right to information and state policies to full public disclosure and transparency in public service. Freedom of Information or FOI is part of the 2017-2022 Philippine Development Plan under ""Ensuring People-Centered, Clean, and Efficient Governance"" specifically on “Subsector Outcome 4: Citizenry fully engaged and empowered”.
The commitment localizes the Freedom of Information (FOI) by passing the Provincial FOI Ordinance and making information accessible through both online and offline platforms, expanding it to include not only demand-driven information but makes readily accessible all available data and information on the provincial government programs and services. Hence, the Presidential Communications Operations Office – the lead agency for the implementation of Executive Order No. 02, is the lead partner of the provincial government in the implementation of this commitment, particularly in terms of providing both technical guidance and financial assistance. The commitment will contribute to all the 17 SDGs but particularly on Sustainable Development Goals 1 (No Poverty), 2 (Zero Hunger), 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), 4 (Quality Education), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

This means that all levels of government have to jointly bring themselves closer to the citizens by becoming more transparent and participatory. The level of local administration must move forward with these recommendations by supporting each other and other levels of government. Diagnosis of the situation: Little awareness in society Deficit in the use of mechanisms for participation and collaboration. Multiple rules, complex in many cases, not developed in some aspects, without sanctioning capacities. Local organization with very small municipalities with difficulties implementing legal obligations. Lack of coordinated action between levels of government and between the different local governments to facilitate and reinforce the participation and collaboration of citizens and society. Problem needing to be resolved: Lack of a space of articulation between local governments that allows building institutional strategies that are more homogeneous, simple and efficient for citizens.; Main objective: Promote the consolidation and operation of the Network of Local Entities for Transparency and Participation as an instrument for: Piloting the evolution of traditional local citizen participation policies towards open government policies. Generate an exchange framework that allows the FEMP to represent, in a sustained and specialized manner, the local administration in the construction of the country's overall open government strategy and facilitate the deployment of the purposes of other governments (Autonomous Communities) with the aim of achieving the maximum social impact.; Brief description of the commitment: Article 1 of the Law regulating the rules of local government describes municipalities as the immediate channels for citizen participation in public affairs, the approval of Law 19/2015 on Transparency and Good Governance and the will to make legislation and to develop its purposes, makes the FEMP Governing Board approve the implementation of the Network of Local Entities for Transparency and Citizen Participation to share insights, resources and promote innovation and the permanent improvement of the relationship between local governments and Citizens under the principles of Open Government, under the prism of governance and collaboration between governments and through the exchange of experiences, lifelong learning, networking and developing projects. Its inspiring VALUES are integrity, willingness to seek solutions, collaboration and exchange, learning and commitment to social innovation. General objectives: Local Governments  1.- Promote the progress of effective policies of transparency, participation and citizen collaboration of Spanish local entities as a whole to achieve stable frameworks of coexistence and favoring the economic and social development of the territories. Citizens/Society  2.- Facilitate the exercise of the rights of access to information and of citizen and society participation at local level, seeking involvement and commitment to public action. Public Value 3.- Reinforcing and increasing the confidence of citizens in local governments, assuming good governance commitments and exemplary practices in the areas of accountability, participation in decision-making and in the design and evaluation of public services. The shareholding partners of the Network are the Local Entities that express, through the corresponding agreement adopted by the Plenum of the Corporation, their express desire to join. Within the framework of the global organization of local representation, United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), the objective is to create a Community of Practice to develop a strategy for the definition and implementation of open government policies at local level in different regions of the world highlighting the work developed at national level by the Network and the URBAN GLASS Ibero-America project.; OPG challenge addressed by the commitment: The commitment aims to operate, transversely, on the set of OGP challenges and considers them as links in a virtuous circle of progress. Increase in public integrity More efficient management of public resources Improvement of public services Increase in corporate responsibility Creation of safer communities; Relevance: The local entities in our country are, for normative reasons, of trajectory and practice, the level of government that articulates communities and territories and a key piece to making the principles of open government among the citizens real as well as activating their prominence. Many local entities have a significant deficit of resources, including those of knowledge, and a collaborative ecosystem must be favored, which spreads and disseminates values and practices and which is willing to share resources. The non-formalization of the commitment of the local entities with the policies of open government and the non-use of the network would suppose: Not reaching the Governments closest to the citizens. Limiting participation as many local entities have difficulty opening channels of collaboration using information technologies and the use of shared resources would allow this. To promote the fragmentation of modes of operation which imply inefficiency for the institutions and complexity for the citizens. This commitment considers it very important to avoid creating gaps in opportunities for participation by territories, people and topics or areas of action and aims to generate balancing mechanisms as well as homogeneous progress.; Aim: Open Government policies are currently in a phase of formulation and development. It is necessary to build systems for sharing, monitoring and evaluation to ensure the correct application of the same and identify if the axes that normalize it find the right balance. In this sense, one of the challenges identified in the deepening of open government models, both in Spain and in particular in Spanish local governments, is to establish an adequate link between policies of transparency and policies of participation and citizen collaboration. Although in the last stage, local governments have focused on transparency in the framework of open government strategies, participation and collaboration require an improvement in the quality of transparency, through the incorporation of mechanisms that offer citizens information about the traceability of the decisions that are adopted and the impulse towards a development that allows the achievement of an integral model of open government. The aim of the commitment is to generate work means and formulas, sustainable over time and accessible for all the members of the ecosystem of those interested in the development of the rights of the people and the principles of Open Government.

ES0044,Spain,4,1,ESP,Europe,National,1,2020,2024,4,Transparency and Accountability,Reform of the Regulatory Framework,Reform laws related to transparency and access to information,"What is the problem/need that is desired to resolve with the commitment? Law 19/2013 of 9 December on transparency, access to public information and good governance fully entered into force the year following its publication in the official gazette for the AGE and two years later for the Autonomous Communities. During the years of validity of the aforementioned law, there has been the need to solve several practical problems, clarify concepts and commit to new approaches in accordance with the demands of the citizenry and Public Administrations. The law corresponds in general terms to the international standards in the subject matter. Transparency is a sensitive public policy that directly impacts the citizenry and is highly demanded by civil society. In fact, 69% of the proposals received in the consultation phase for the 4th Open Government plan were related to transparency, open data and accountability. 

Objectives of the commitment Strengthen and delve deeper into the public policy of transparency in Spain through modifying its regulatory standards and promote Spain's ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents of 18 June 2009. 1. Approve the transparency regulation, which is in an advanced state of processing, complementing the regulation with regard to the aspects related to the Transparency Website, as a point that provides access to the information, facilitating compliance with the obligations of active transparency and favouring the exercise of the right to access to public information. 2. Promote the ratification by Spain of the Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents of 2009, in order to highlight Spain's commitment to transparency at the international level and cause a ""chameleon effect"" in other countries. 3. Reform the law on transparency, access to information and good governance. The scope of this reform must be profiled in the consultation and public hearing processes, even though it is considered necessary to examine the most demanded matters by the citizenry such as the expansion of the obligations of active transparency, the maximum guarantees in exercising the right to access and the activity of the enforcement bodies and promoting citizen participation in public affairs. 52 

Brief description of the commitment 1. Complete the processing of the regulation for the development of the transparency law to facilitate compliance with the active transparency obligations and promote exercising the right to access to public information by the people concerned with the maximum guarantees and always for the sake of ensuring the greatest transparency possible in the actions of the Public Administration 2. Promote Spain's ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents. 3. Modify Law 19/2013, of 9 December, on transparency, access to public information and good governance to adapt it to the national and international context in the subject matter and introduce improvements in accordance with the needs detected during its years of validity. 

How does the commitment contribute to solve the problem or cover the need? The commitment is directly related to the demands for improvement by the citizenry, Transparency Council, Public Administrations, the doctrine and jurisprudence. 

Why is the commitment relevant with respect to the values of Open Government? Transparency constitutes one of the essential pillars of open government through society scrutinising public information.

ES0048,Spain,4,5,ESP,Europe,National,1,2020,2024,4,Integrity,Public Integrity Systems,Public Integrity Systems,"According to the Framework Document approved in 2019 by the group of Public Administrations and civil society within the Permanent Commission of the Open Government Forum and the Sectoral Commission of Open Government, the 4th Plan must be oriented towards the objective of building a system of public integrity, strengthening the ethical values and mechanisms to consolidate the integrity of the public institutions and bolster the citizenry's confidence. This commitment corresponds to a strategy to strengthen the preventative systems of public integrity from various perspectives, taking into account the main contributions of the citizenry to draft the 4th Open Government Plan. In this way, it contains four lines of action:  Diagnosis and improvement of the systems of public integrity. Development of risk maps, codes of conduct, ethics climate surveys, self‐evaluation guides and training for civil servants.  Regulation of a mandatory registry of lobbies  Amendment of the law on disqualification of the staff at the service of the Public Administrations  Reinforcement of Integrity in specific areas: public integrity and artificial intelligence

5.1
What is the problem/need that is desired to resolve with the commitment? In the words of the OECD, public integrity refers to the constant alignment and appropriation of ethical values, principles and shared standards, to protect and prioritise public interest about private interests in the public sector (OECD, 2016). At this point, it is important to reconsider society's demands and define new principles and guidelines that guide the exercise of public responsibilities, with standards that are most suitable for today's society, codes of conduct, specific lines of action, training programmes and accountability mechanisms. For these reasons, it is considered appropriate to carry out a general diagnosis of the preventative systems of public integrity existing in the State General Administration, based on which we can plan a framework of improvement actions in said environment for the highest ranking officials and the civil servants, in accordance with the values of public integrity, transparency and responsibility, thus reaffirming the confidence of the citizenry in public service. 74 

Objectives of the commitment To strengthen the systems of public integrity through a set of measures with a preferably preventative intention, which fosters the detection of irregular actions. Brief description of the commitment It seeks to carry out a diagnosis of the integrity systems existing within the State General Administration that allows identifying strong points and areas of improvement, based on which preventative actions can be planned by the public officials in accordance with the current Administration. This will allow establishing monitoring systems of the organizations in successive phases through the development of risk maps and improvement plans, preparing codes of conduct, carrying out surveys and self‐evaluation of the ethical climate, promoting values of integrity in the quality management models of the organizations and improving the training and advising of the civil servants on these subjects. 

How does the commitment contribute to solve the problem or cover the need? It contributes to building a system of public integrity, strengthening the ethical values and mechanisms to bolster the integrity of the public institutions and reinforce the trust of the citizenry. 

Why is the commitment relevant with respect to the values of Open Government? 1. Without a doubt, the establishment of preventative public integrity systems promotes, strengthens and improves the quality of participation in public management, given that it allows the citizenry and civil society organisations to participate in making public decisions related to this commitment, in order to achieve better results and a better quality democracy. 2. The collaboration with actors involved in civil society delves deeper into transparency, through carrying out actions intended for its improvement and the evaluation of results, in this case, of the programmes regarding the development of integrity systems. 3. Logically, the greater relevance of the defined commitment results, by its very definition and the activities it entails, in contributing to build a system of public integrity, strengthening the ethical values and mechanisms to strengthen the integrity of public institutions and reinforce trust among the citizenry. 4. This commitment also seeks to raise awareness among civil servants on Open Government values.

Additional information  As a complement to the activities that form part of the commitment, and as a presentation of it, it would be feasible to coordinate a space on the Transparency Website to report the specific actions that will be developed regarding public integrity and related information that further details the commitment and its activities, actions by the actors involved and supervisor bodies in the subject area, and notable good practises at the national level.  Initially, the commitment does not have a quantified independent budget, given that to the extent possible, the activities will be developed with the own personal means of the public actors and civil society involved, including the eventual economic costs in the current budgets of the directive centres or organisations as own actions of their functions. 75 

Activities of the commitment Date Start Date End 1.

5.2
""What is the problem/need that is desired to resolve with the commitment? Regulating the relations of the lobbies with the leaders of groups thus covers a legal vacuum in our regulations that has been emphasized by both international organisations and civil society. 

Objectives of the commitment To establish a law applicable to the State General Administration and the organisations and related entities of Public Law and dependent on them, which defines the actions and relations of these groups in terms of disclosure and avoiding conflicts of interests. 

Brief description of the commitment ‐ Definition. ‐ Framework of action. ‐ Establishment of disclosure and registry standards. ‐ Duties and obligations of the people forming part of these groups. ‐ Limitations of the rotating doors between senior officials and civil servants on the one hand, and lobbies, on the other. ‐ Allocate the management of this Registry to the Office of Conflicts of Interest. 

How does the commitment contribute to solve the problem or cover the need? It contributes by establishing the flow of participation in a transparent and public manner of the pressure groups, in such a way that the interests of these groups contribute to adopt public decisions. 

Why is the commitment relevant with respect to the values of Open Government? The regulations that govern the lobbies will represent a clear strengthening in terms of quality, improving the transparency of the participation of lobbies in the decision‐making. On the other hand, the establishment of a code of conduct for the people representing these groups will represent an improvement in the prevention of conflicts in exercising the public jobs and positions. Of course, it is an essential standard in relation to a system of Public Integrity.

5.3
What is the problem/need that is desired to resolve with the commitment? To adapt the regulations that govern the incompatibilities and conflicts of interest of civil servants to the needs of the current Administration and the values of honesty and integrity that society demands. 

Objectives of the commitment Within the Integrity Plan that establishes new standards of action of public officials, a new system of preventing conflicts of interest must be defined and establish new codes of conduct with clear, specific and defined principles. Brief description of the commitment ‐ Establishment of a system of incompatibilities of termination ‐ Extension to the advisers (eventual staff) of the regime of incompatibilities of high positions, as well as the publication of their CVs. ‐ Defining the activities exempt from the regime of incompatibilities by virtue of the provisions established in article 19.h of the Law. To more effectively regulate the conditions of compatibility with private activity 

How does the commitment contribute to solve the problem or cover the need? It represents a review of the current regulations to establish the disfunctionalities detected in its application and the demands of society, establishing a new system of preventing conflicts of interest and in accordance with the current Administration. 

Why is the commitment relevant with respect to the values of Open Government? It improves transparency and accountability through new demands of disclosure and control. On the other hand, it is directly related to a new system of public integrity and implementation of ethical values in the actions of staff at the service of the Public Administrations. 

Additional information  Commitment budget.

5.4
""What is the problem/need that is desired to resolve with the commitment? - The adoption of data‐based technology is creating opportunities in our economy and in the Administration's service to the citizenry. However, any information system that the public administration is equipped with to support its decision‐making must safeguard at least the same values and standards as those that are supported today, such as transparency, responsibility, non‐discrimination, data protection and security, among others. - Although Artificial Intelligence can offer many advantages, it also has its risks. The main risks related to the use of artificial intelligence affect the application of standards designed to protect the essential rights (such as the protection of personal data and privacy, and non‐discrimination) and security, as well as the questions related to civil liability. The States should adopt mechanisms to mitigate these risks in the public and private sector. The regulatory framework should be focused on how to minimise the different risks of suffering damages, especially the most significant ones - An artificial intelligence system can make decisions or advise civil servants on how to make them. The Public Administrations should guarantee that the civil service responsible for AI systems knows those systems and receives continuous training. The result of using Artificial Intelligence techniques in public administration may lead to the disappearance of repetitive tasks that do not provide value. In exchange, civil servants can focus on the tasks where human intelligence does add value (such as supervising decisions of automated systems, auditing, traceability). We can use the term """"bot administration"""" to refer to the programmes, systems and applications that allow carrying out this specific type of electronic administrative action, which will become increasingly common. - Algorithmic transparency involves the capacity to know which data are used, how they are used, who use them, what they use them for, how data‐based decisions are made that affect the vital sphere of whoever requests this type of decision‐making. We are talking about AI systems that manage massive volumes of data and make decisions as a function of what they learn. In these systems, it may extraordinarily difficult to know what the decision‐making process was. However, it is requested that any system that makes decisions supported by learning algorithms provides in some way an explanation about what the process was for making or recommending a decision. There are systems in which it is very difficult or almost impossible to find an explanation for this decision‐making process. Transparency not only affects the algorithm, but also the data that it is based on. 

Objectives of the commitment - Identify the measures that we should take to maximise the benefits of data management and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for our society and economy, identify and minimise the risks. - Analyse if it is sufficiently compliance with the Spanish Laws on the Defence of Consumers or if it is necessary to adapt the national laws to facilitate the burden of proof of the victims of damages related to AI. - To train civil servants on the concepts of AI and its uses in the Public Administration - Encourage the use of reliable algorithms and open code, and methodologies of projects that include reliability Brief description of the commitment - Preparation of a Guide of Use of Artificial Intelligence for the public sector that addresses the ethical principles and includes a list of recommendations for the use of AI, a methodology to approach an artificial intelligence 81 project, and a questionnaire to evaluate a reliable AI. Pursue the adoption of this guide in the Public Administrations. - Creation of the Data and Ethics in Innovation Centre. Its function will be to offer recommendations, advise the Public Administration and the Industry to foment ethical responsibility in enabling technologies and innovation, as well as recommend the analyses of the standards to guarantee the responsible use of AI, and that it is no less than with other products. - Implementation of an AI training or informative activity for civil servants. - Encourage methodologies in the projects that include reliability from the design. The points to take into account in transparency are: - Use reliable algorithms, avoiding errors in the design of algorithms, because after all, they were created by humans. - Use reliable data samples to train AI‐based systems. - Review the results with reliable trial data - Regularly supervise the decisions 

How does the commitment contribute to solve the problem or cover the need? - Governments are facing the obligation to foment industrial and scientific development, and at the same time, develop a framework that at the same time, provides legal security to researchers and business owners, foments technological development, guarantees a sustainable environment from the economic and social point of view, and is respectful of our model of rights and liberties. - The complexity introduced by some of the technologies that form part of the framework of artificial intelligence, such as robotics, automated decision‐making, automated learning and virtual assistants have opened the debate regarding legal responsibility. It ranges from including a supportive responsibility to the allocation of a legal personality to these systems. The objective will be to advise the regulators, providers and developers in responsible and reliable innovation. The Data and Ethics in Innovation Centre could also consider implementing a prototype of a voluntary system of """"ethics responsibility regarding data"""". - In many cases, the value generated by a civil servant cannot be replaced by AI, which will be an ally for carrying out its functions. However, for that reason, it is necessary to train the staff of the Public Administrations. - Promoting the use of reliable algorithms will increase reliability and transparency in AI projects 

Why is the commitment relevant with respect to the values of Open Government? It contributes to building a system of public integrity, strengthening the ethical values and mechanisms to bolster the integrity of the public institutions and reinforce the trust of the citizenry

How does the commitment contribute to solve the problem or cover the need? 83 This initiative should be a priority because it will be an especially useful tool in the fight against corruption, and the protection of people who report infractions and violations of the law, both in the public and private spheres. 

Why is the commitment relevant with respect to the values of Open Government? It has a clear transformational impact on the citizenry and the openness of public policies, given that it involves raising the awareness of the citizenry on the fight against corruption, and transmission of the involvement of public administrations in it by obliging them to deploy whistleblower channels that facilitate the knowledge of the facts and protection measures that guarantee the indemnification of the whistleblower. 

Additional information It must be noted that the transposition is subject to a deadline that ends 17 December 2021. In addition, the ""minimal"" nature must be pointed out as well as the possibility to expand the protection to areas not set forth by the Directive.

ES0090,Spain,4,10.38,ESP,Europe,National,1,2020,2024,4,NA,Approval Of The Law On Transparency In Autonomous Regions,Draft and approve law on transparency,"What is the problem/need that is desired to resolve with the commitment? In the Balearic Islands Government, the law that mainly collects questions of transparency on the previous Law 4/2011 of 31 March on good administration and Good Government, and therefore, the basic state law (Law 19/2013 of 9 December, on transparency, access to public information and good governance). Though the transparency policy has been instrumented with these two tools, it is necessary to advance in this subject matter through the approval of a new law that regulates and expands the transparency obligations to improve the accountability that articulates the right of access to information. Likewise, the lack of a sanctioning system represents a weakness in relation to requiring compliance with the aforementioned obligations. 

Objectives of the commitment To advance regarding transparency, expanding the commitments in this area and providing legal security through the approval of a law that provides the main questions of Law 19/2013 adapted to our Autonomous Community, also adding a sanctioning system that ensures its adequate compliance. 

Brief description of the commitment Approval of an autonomous region law on transparency in development of Law 19/2013 of 9 November on transparency, access to public information and good governance, featuring the participation of the interested agents during the period of public consultation and processing of the hearing. 

How does the commitment contribute to solve the problem or cover the need? With the new Law, it will be possible to advance in the obligations of active advertising and establish some questions related to organising the right of access and the development of the proceeding that require being passed into law. Likewise, a sanctioning procedure can be established that reinforces the compliance with said obligations. 

Why is the commitment relevant with respect to the values of Open Government? It promotes, strengthens and improves the quality of participation in the public management, allowing the citizenship to participate in making public decisions with the objective of achieving better results and better democratic quality. Given the processing, a prior public consultation will be carried out, and with all of the corresponding participatory proceedings during its processing (hearing and public information), which will allow enriching the debate and having contributions from the citizenship in this respect. It delves deeper into transparency, open data and accountability of Public Administrations through carrying out actions aimed at its improvement and the evaluation of the results of the plans and programmes. A new Law will expand the active advertising obligations, which will improve the accountability and transparency. Likewise, it will refer to the preference for reusable formats and open data. It contributes to building a system of public integrity, strengthening the ethical values and mechanisms to bolster the integrity of the public institutions and reinforce the trust of the citizenship. 214 A new law that reinforces compliance with the active advertising obligations and right of access results in strengthening the trust of the citizenship by reinforcing the commitment towards transparency. It raises awareness among society and civil servants about the values of Open Government, contributing to the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda in order to advance towards a just, peaceful and inclusive society. The processing of the law will allow disclosing this subject matter to civil servants and the different governing bodies, enabling them to participate. Likewise, after its approval, it will be included in the training plan, which would also contribute to expand the raising of awareness towards the civil servants. The media impact of the approval of the law will also carry the message of transparency in society.

ES0098,Spain,4,10.46,ESP,Europe,National,1,2020,2024,4,NA,"Approval Of The Law On Transparency, Access To Information And Its Reuse",Draft and approve law on transparency and right to information,"What is the problem/need that is desired to resolve with the commitment? With the approval in 2012 of the Open Government. Model by Agreement 17/2012 of 8 March of the Castilla y León Regional Government, the autonomous region government started its journey in the opening and dissemination of public information and the implementation of new channels for citizen participation in making decisions in advance of the approval of the basic state regulation on transparency. Law 3/2015 of 4 March on Transparency and Citizen Participation of Castilla y León offered regulatory coverage to this process, albeit with a very reduced impact as a result of a timid promotion of active advertising and the right of access to public information and leaving out very significant actors in this Autonomous Region, such as local entities. In addition, it would not be a mistake to state that in the overall context of the autonomous region initiatives to develop the basic state regulations on transparency, the law has proven to be a standard that has not responded as hoped to the demands and requirements of society. With this background, the future law cannot face the important and growing challenges of our times in terms of the design and implementation of a true transparency policy at the autonomous region level, which involves everyone, while compromising in any way, in order to continue strengthening democracy and the functioning of the institutions, improve the lives of the citizenship and of course, serve to also promote the growth and development of our land. These are some of the purposes this law strives for. It also strives to promote citizen participation thanks to better access to information, which will make it possible to have a greater active and responsible presence of society in the collective affairs, and the improved efficiency in public management by showing its results at the scrutiny of everyone. 

Objectives of the commitment To approve a new law on transparency, access to public information and its reuse in order to advance towards a greater openness of public information to the citizenship and a real and more effective accountability 

Brief description of the commitment Achieving the commitment involves the processing of a new regulatory initiative, which implies from the writing the drafts of the initial texts, proceedings of citizen participation, hearing and public information, to the parliamentary approval of a regulation and its publication 

How does the commitment contribute to solve the problem or cover the need? It is necessary to approve a demanding standard that is in accordance with the current times in order to achieve the objectives that we are proposing: elevate the demands of active advertising, incorporate new subjects obliged by law, improve the exercising of the right of access, removing unnecessary obstacles and promoting the policy of reuse of public information. At the same time, the initiative incorporates a sanctionary regime that until now has not existed, in order to de‐incentivise violating it. 

Why is the commitment relevant with respect to the values of Open Government? It promotes, strengthens and improves the quality of participation in the public management, allowing the citizenship to participate in making public decisions with the objective of achieving better results and better democratic quality. 234 The approval of this standard will allow getting to know public management better in order to thus guarantee the accountability, access all content that are necessary to promote citizen participation, and in brief, make possible the right to know and understand what happens in the public ""office"". It delves deeper into transparency, open data and accountability of Public Administrations through carrying out actions aimed at its improvement and the evaluation of the results of the plans and programmes. The proposals of the future initiative include achieving a better active advertising, a right of access to public information that features fewer obstacles and an open data policy that is free of charge, without restrictions and by default. It contributes to building a system of public integrity, strengthening the ethical values and mechanisms to bolster the integrity of the public institutions and reinforce the trust of the citizenship. Without being an initiative directed toward improving public integrity (in this legislation, these are being promoted with this specific objective, like the creation of an agency to fight against fraud and whistleblower protection), it allows for a greater public scrutiny of the public management through active advertising and the right of access guarantees greater integrity and avoiding corrupt and irregular practises. It raises awareness among society and civil servants about the values of Open Government, contributing to the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda in order to advance towards a just, peaceful and inclusive society. The initiative is directly linked to SDG 16, strengthens democracy and the participation of everyone in the management of public affairs.

Both these processes had public participation provisions until an amendment to the NEA in 2000 took away the public’s right to comment on IEEs. Until this amendment public comments were called through a notice published in the government gazette and a newspaper in all three languages. As it stands today the public have the right to comment only on EIA reports which is notified through the newspaper only, while IEEs are merely public documents for the purposes of the Evidence Ordinance and are only open for inspection by the public. The decision to approve through both IEEs and EIAs is notified through the newspaper. Without notice to public on the availability of IEEs (as in EIAs), it is most unlikely that the public will get to know of projects that are approved through IEEs. This is unsatisfactory and discriminatory, especially in respect of projects where the affected public may be residing far away from the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Registry where such reports are likely to be kept. In addition, since there are no guidelines in the NEA for determining whether a project needs an IEE or an EIA the removal of the public notice and participation provisions in respect of IEE Reports may encourage Project Approving Agencies and developers to opt for the latter in preference to an EIA irrespective of the actual environmental impacts. A civil society provided example is the approval of a mini hydropower project in the Koskulana River bordering the Sinharaja World Heritage Site through an IEE. Public became aware of the project through the media only after the same was approved and damaged caused to the Sinharaja World Heritage Site.  In addition to the aforesaid laws the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance No.2 of 1937 as amended (FFPO) and the North Western Province Environmental Statute No.12 of 1990 as amended (NWPES) also provide for the IEE/EIA process. However, unlike the NEA and CCCRMA, the FFPO and the NWPES require that IEEs are open for public comments. It needs to be stressed that where public law allows comments on IEEs/EIAs, the decision making agencies need to be accountable for the public comments received.  In order to ensure the same, the decision-making agency must list the comments received on IEEs and EIAs and indicate whether the comments were addressed or not when arriving at the project approval decision. Therefore, it is proposed that: (a) Relevant amendments are made to (i) the NEA and its regulations; and (ii) the CCCRMA, the CCCRMP and regulations to restore/include the public’s right to study and comment on IEE Reports before projects are approved; and (b) Relevant amendments are made to (i) the NEA and its regulations; (ii) the CCCRMA, the CCCRMP and regulations (iii) the FFPO and its regulations and (iv) the NWPES and its regulations to include provisions ensuring government accountability on public comments on IEEs and EIAs. Issues to be Addressed: Lack of provisions in the NEA and CCCRMA to include public participation in the IEE process. Lack of government accountability on public comments received on IEEs and EIAs Main Objective: Ensuring public participation/transparency in environmental decision making and government accountability on public comments on IEEs and EIAs National Environmental Act (NEA) Amendments

An amendment to the CCCRMA in 2011 gives the Director General of CCCRM the discretion to call for an IEE and/or an EIA upon receipt of an application for a development permit for a development activity within the Coastal Zone. The Minister is empowered to prescribe by regulation categories of development activities for which an IEE is not necessary. In order to ensure that environmental impacts are adequately addressed when implementing projects, it is necessary that the IEE process under the CCCRMA is also open for public comments. 
It needs to be stressed that where public law allows comments on IEEs/EIAs, the decision making agencies need to be accountable for the public comments received.  In order to ensure the same, the decision-making agency must list the comments received on IEEs and EIAs and indicate whether the comments were addressed or not when arriving at the project approval decision.

However, unlike the NEA and CCCRMA, the FFPO and the NWPES require that IEEs are open for public comments.  It needs to be stressed that where public law allows comments on IEEs/EIAs, the decision making agencies need to be accountable for the public comments received.  In order to ensure the same, the decision-making agency must list the comments received on IEEs and EIAs and indicate whether the comments were addressed or not when arriving at the project approval decision. 

Therefore, it is proposed that:
(a)	Relevant amendments are made to (i) the NEA and its regulations; and (ii) the CCCRMA, the CCCRMP and regulations to restore/include the public’s right to study and comment on IEE Reports before projects are approved; and
(b)	Relevant amendments are made to (i) the NEA and its regulations; (ii) the CCCRMA, the CCCRMP and regulations (iii) the FFPO and its regulations and (iv) the NWPES and its regulations to include provisions ensuring government accountability on public comments on IEEs and EIAs.

At the last periodic state review in 2011, where Sri Lanka was reviewed, CEDAW issued numerous concluding observations to Sri Lankan government. As a state party, Sri Lankan government is obliged to follow up on the concluding observations. In the framework of this commitment, the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs will follow upon specific concluding observations on selected areas; Personal Law reforms, gender equality in state land distribution, non-discrimination in formal and informal employment sector. Consultations with community will increase accountability of the ministry of Women and Child Affairs to the public and will allow women’s networks to directly participate in improving public services and increasing public integrity.

It also serves as a tool for the systematic elimination of corruption. It balances the power of the people against the concentration of power in public authorities. The components of a democracy - such as representation, accountability, and participatory decision-making – are facilitated by the introduction of a dynamic RTI framework. Issues to be Addressed: Resources need to be allocated and the State has to roll out the entire RTI infrastructure. Systems (including ICT) have to be developed for record management, reporting, proactive disclosure and responding to requests. Public Authorities and their respective officials have to be trained and sensitized to the principles and processes of RTI. This includes ensuring the autonomy of appointed Information and Designated Officers.

 Commitment description
 What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Persons with disabilities do not enjoy equal rights and privileges as other citizens in society. They are deprived of basic entitlements enjoyed by other citizens due to physical and psychological barriers in society. In Sri Lanka, 1.6 M (8.7%) persons are living with disabilities. The existing disability legislation, Act No. 28 of 1996 is limited to access to education, employment and physical accessibility to public places. With the ratification of UNCPRD (UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) in 2016, the government is accountable to prepare local legislation in line with UNCPRD. The proposed Disability Rights Bill, however, has been formulated with the absence of two separate mechanisms, i.e1) coordination of implementation and 2) independent monitoring as per article 33 of UNCPRD. 
 What is the commitment? The purpose of this commitment is to prepare a revised bill by the Ministry in charge of Social Welfare based on public consultations and in line with UNCPRD. 
 How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? The accommodation of 2 separate mechanisms in disability legislation as per article 33 of the UNCPRD, i.e coordination of implementation and independent monitoring will lead to improvement of the quality of life of persons with disabilities. Persons with disabilities will be able to access the draft bill in disability-friendly modes of communication. An island wide publicity campaign will be conducted on the provisions of the Disability Rights Act highlighting the entitlement of persons with disabilities.
 Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? This commitment promotes public accountability as it provides for legislation to promote and ensure the rights of persons with disabilities. 
 Additional information This commitment promotes the provisions of the National Human Rights Action Plan 2017-2021, disability legislation in Sri Lanka; the recommendations and commitments in the Draft Sustainable Sri Lanka: Vision & Strategic Path and the Vision 2025; targets influencing disability rights in crosscutting Sustainable Development Goals.

 1. The existing bill is revised based on public consultations in line with UNCPRD by the Ministry in charge. Already started May 2019 
 2. The draft will be available in alternative modes of communication for persons with disabilities (i.e. Braille, Sign Language etc.) for comments and feedback December 2019 April 2020

 Lead implementing agency/actor Ministry in charge of Women’s Affairs
 Commitment description
 What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Under the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which Sri Lanka ratified in 1981, the country is obliged to deliver on several Concluding Observations but the pace of progress has been slow. Effective implementation of CEDAW provisions would have alleviated many current problems faced by women. Women in the informal sector are subject to unequal wages in the absence of legal protection. The lower participation of women in the workforce is also an issue. Women Heads of Household also face many socio, cultural, economic and political concerns which are not adequately addressed. Women also experience work-place sexual and gender based violence in the formal sector. The issues include low level of women representation in political governance, and accessibility of women to State Lands.
 What is the commitment? This commitment seeks to promote the implementation of selected Concluding Observations of the CEDAW in work plans of related Ministries by 2020. It will thereby enhance action to prevent women being discriminated in the informal sector, increase participation of women in political governance, promote accountability and transparency in national policy formulation for women heads of households, minimize work place related sexual harassment and remove discriminatory land laws affecting women. The Ministry in charge of Labour and Trade Union Relations also intends to propose a mechanism for minimum wage and will have provisions against discriminatory activities at workplace.
 How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? Establishing regulations to make “Equal pay for work of equal value” will make it mandatory for all informal sector employees to obtain equal wages for work of equal value, thereby providing protection through the law. Stakeholder consultations and monitoring will contribute to the learning that is needed to monitor and expand the plan towards eradicating this inequality. Policies and plans being developed to address the concerns of women headed households will be more transparent and effective by enabling the direct participation of WHH in the process. Work-place sexual and gender based violence in the formal sector will be minimized through the appointment of Sexual Harassment Committees. The amendment to the laws relating to State Lands will increase women’s access to State Land. The provision of a quota system in parliament through amending election laws along with CSOs will contribute to increase women’s participation in political governance. 
 Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? This commitment promotes public participation as women, including vulnerable groups, are provided with specific arrangements to participate and influence decision making. Accountability is improved through mechanisms for monitoring, participation of stakeholders and obligations for relevant public authorities to disclose information pertaining to decisions and consultations. 
 Additional information The Commitment supports the implementation of the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women; the objectives of the National Human Rights Action Plan 2017-2021; the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goal No. 5 which calls for gender equality. 
 Milestone Activity with a verifiable deliverable Start Date: End Date:

 Lead implementing agency/actor Ministry in charge of Child Affairs 
 Commitment description
 What is the public problem that the commitment will address? Sri Lanka is bound by international obligations to safeguard the rights of Sri Lankan children having ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in 1991. In this regard, the Committee on the Rights of the Child monitors the progress made on these obligations by reviewing the information submitted by each State Party and makes recommendations or “Concluding Observations” to help States improve the situation of children. 
 
 The latest Concluding Observations on Sri Lanka made in 2018 have identified the main factors leading to violations of child rights and make recommendations on how they could be prevented. Sri Lanka is required to submit its next periodic report by 2023 and to include therein information on the follow-up to the present Concluding Observations. Recommendations have been made to address a number of issues including low level of societal awareness on child rights; gender-based violence; children deprived of a family environment; effects of climate change on child rights; internally displaced children; trafficking in children etc. It is important to note, however, that the skills and knowledge of parties with responsibility to implement these recommendations are at a low level. 
 What is the commitment? By implementing the relevant recommendations of the UNCRC Concluding Observations, the Ministry in charge of child affairs, together with other agencies, aims to strengthen its efforts to build a country in which the rights of children are protected. In this regard, the Ministry recognizes the need to create a knowledgeable society that is aware of child rights and the importance of safeguarding them; consider legislative changes in the light of cultural changes; and enable social recognition for activists appearing for child rights. 
 How will the commitment contribute to solve the public problem? This commitment will increase the awareness on the importance of safeguarding child rights. It will promote behaviour and practices to hear the opinion of children when taking decisions concerning them; empower the society to report on incidences of child exploitation; and effectively address factors that contribute to violence against children.
 Why is this commitment relevant to OGP values? This commitment enhances public participation, transparency and accountability through social mobilization to identify instances of child rights violations and initiatives to protect child rights. 
 Additional information The responsibilities to protect the rights of children facilitated through this commitment will help promote societal values.

life easier, open up administration in order to support innovation and participation, and increase operational quality and effectiveness as stated in the eGovernment strategy
‘Putting the citizen at the centre’. The strategy has three objectives:
- simplicity, in order to develop easy and user-friendly solutions;
- transparency and innovation, in order to take advantage of digital opportunities to increase transparency, strengthen democracy, and contribute to increased economic growth through open data; and
- increased efficiency through digitisation.
Transparency and openness are crucial to democratic accountability. Therefore transparency and access to information about government administration are vital. Supplying public sector information and digital services in standardised formats allows businesses and organisations to re-use it and to develop their own services. These services can supplement the range of services delivered by government agencies and meet diverse civic needs. The commitment will mainly be achieved through continuing the implementation of the eGovernment strategy ‘Putting the citizen at the centre’ including strengthening the governance of the digitisation efforts of the government administration.
Main activities
- Develop a multi-annual reform-programme to be presented in Budget bill for 2015, called the Digital move in order to achieve the objectives of the Putting the citizen at the centre strategy, as well as support other public digitisation efforts.

SE0009,Sweden,2,2,SWE,Europe,National,1,2014,2016,2,NA,A step further on the re-use of public administration documents,A Step Further on the Re-Use of Public Administration Documents,"The commitment on a step further on the re-use of public administration documents aims to enhance economic growth, greater openness and better service for citizens. Various estimates point to considerable value for society when the re-use of public administration documents is increased. When information from the public sector is being re-used, compiled, processed and made available, the ability of citizens to gain insight and make demands on government activities increases. A more open government can increase its legitimacy among citizens and their willingness to participate in the development of the service level, efficiency and quality of public services. The commitment will mainly be achieved through changes in Swedish legislation, proposed by a Government Inquiry and actions to promote and monitor the re-use of public administration documents.
Main activities
- Prepare for changes in the Act on the re-use of public administration documents (2010:566) in order to implement the Directive 2013/37/EU (Public Sector Information Directive).7
- Support initiatives related to the project ‘Application profile for data portals in
Europe’ (DCAT-AP), where Sweden participates.8
- Continue to facilitate actions in order to promote agencies’ re-use of public administration documents at different levels.
- Improve comprehensive follow-up and monitoring, including continuing to systematically give missions to agencies to report on their work on re-using public administration documents.

Commitment Description
1. Local Context and Needs As established during public consultation with regard to services in Tbilisi City Hall system, there was lack of awareness about the existing services in Tbilisi City Hall and there was a need for setting up one window principle for provision of services and a number of other proposals were voiced that would serve the aim of improvement of the services (see the protocols of the Open Government Working Group N3 and Public Consultation Protocols, 31.07.18, 01.08.18, 06.08.18 and 07.08.18). Naturally, the low level of public awareness of the City Hall services is hindering the adequate use of these services. However, the population as the recipient of services is not involved in the provision of the appropriate feedback to the Tbilisi City Hall as there is no mechanism for such a feedback. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the accessibility of the City Hall services, take important steps to establish one window principle and introduce a system based on continuous improvement of services that first of all means establishment of a mechanism for receiving feedback from service consumers. 2. Commitment Content Description An integrated web application will be created that will enable the citizens to have online access without leaving home to the most demanded interconnected services within the City Hall system, with the aim to establish one window principle within the scope of these services. In the first phase, apart from the architecture and urban development directions, the following services will be subject to the inclusion in the list of online services: all services of the Environmental Protection Department and City Transport Department, as well as all functions of the Municipal Supervision Department that by their content are attributed to services used by citizens(the exact listing of the latter will be defined at the first stage of the fulfillment of this commitment, provided for in Appendix N3).Besides technical provision of the above mentioned services, an important step for the improvement of the access to full information and access to services of the City Hall system will also be the 
establishment of a one-window principle. Web-App will enable the citizens to create their own online account, get the services without having to go to the municipality and manage their information. Access will also be possible through the mobile app. The format will take into account the possibility of reporting the information, the feedback by citizens on the services. This information will be subject to periodic analysis by Tbilisi City Hall, service providers will analyze and summarize the received feedback and statistical data of electronic services. This analysis will be made publicly available and will be used by Tbilisi City Hall to improve services. Legal basis will be established for the procedures related to this mechanism. 3. Positive outcome for the Public Substantial increase in availability and raised awareness on services that will facilitate easy access to services and will somewhat improve the quality of life of citizens. The introduction of online services will also create an additional basis for implementing of more efficient improvements, as well as increased awareness will create additional grounds for more effective civic feedback and participation:

- A law on illicit enrichment:
This law aims at establishing mechanisms to report corruption cases, and setting up special measures to protect whistleblowers that witness corruption cases within the public sector. The law will sustain the effort of fighting the phenomenon of corruption that threatens public resources, and will reduce its effects at different levels of the government, including central and local level and all structures involved in public services delivery.
This law aims to determine the list of high government officials and who are obliged to disclose their assets declaration in accordance to specific procedures and after defining the control mechanism and the applied sanctions. This would replace the law n° 1987-17 of April 10th, 1987, related to government member’s declaration of honor, and all related legislation.
This law aims at defining illicit enrichment of public officials, their spouses or children. And so, with the addition of expenses that are made by or for the benefit of any persons involved in illicit enrichment.

In accordance with the Action Plan for implementing the Open Government Partnership Initiative in 2018–2020 (as approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine ordinance No. 1088 on 18 December 2020), the Budget for Citizens module in the ‘Transparent Budget’ Information and Analytical System, and also the sub-system Register of Projects of Economic and Social Development of Ukraine Supported by the International Financial Organizations, were put into operation. At the same time, there is a need to expand the capabilities of the information and analytical system. Further developing the Budget for Citizens module (openbudget.gov.ua) of the ‘Transparent Budget’ Information and Analytical System software would allow for the creating a new sub-section, Budget Program Indicators, containing information on budget requests, the budget program passports of main local spending units, and budget program passport execution reports. This information will facilitate better understanding by taxpayers of the way their taxes are spent, from the local budget planning stage. Developing and introducing an electronic Contract module in the integrated automated platform will provide an interface for creating, agreeing, signing, processing, transferring, and publishing electronic contracts and reporting on execution thereof. Such a module will make it possible to create procedures for contract development and administration, and expand the capacity of the liquidity management system. The availability of an electronic contract will make it possible to obtain structured contracts and enable additional opportunities for creating analytical instruments based on the data from the electronic procurement system. The objective would beto both improve the quality of public governance in the sphere of procurement and to exercise state financial and public control over the application of public funds. An e-Contract module will improve access to information on procurement and minimise risks for all participants in the procurement process. Implementing the above measure will secure the transparency and publicity of Ukraine’s budget system by way of publishing information on budget requests, budget programme passports, and their execution reports by all main local budget spending units; improving public governance in the sphere of public procurement; and, applying the mechanism for feedback and discussion of issues relating to the application of budget funds. 5

The Register collates information on all state-owned assets (buildings, structures, equipment, etc.) owned by state administration bodies and legal entities (state asset holders) exercising economic jurisdiction and operational management of state-owned assets. This Register will make it possible to: maintain state asset accounting, taking into consideration geospatial data (geolocation); effectively manage the assets and transparency of selling state-owned assets; mainstream entering up-to-date, complete, and reliable data on state assets into the Register; establish the basis for taking effective managerial decisions on the use of state-owned assets; provide administrative services for releasing information (data or extracts) from the Register in an electronic format, based on Register data; access to public information on state assets by publishing information on state-owned assets from the Register, in the form of open data, on the Unified State Open Data Web Portal. 8

UA0090,Ukraine,5,4,UKR,Europe,National,1,2020,2022,2,NA,Implementing the state open science policy,Open Science,"Ukrainian scientists are unable to fully unlock their scientific potential due to the lack of properly developed facilities and resources for research institutions and higher educational institutions; little extra-budgetary allocations going to research infrastructure; and, insufficient development of the electronic academic archives system. The competitiveness of scientific research, R&D, and experimental developments is reduced dramatically. Moreover, transferring scientific data obtained in research and experiments funded fully or in part from the state budget to reliable, publicly accessible permanent storage is not mandatory under standard practices and lacks regulatory requirements; there is also a lack of the relevant instruments, including permanent index assignments and archiving procedures. In light of the above, valuable scientific information remains inaccessible to the academic community and, in may cases, is lost after scientific projects are completed, which compromises trust in scientific results obtained by domestic researchers and hinders developing practices for reusing thereof, slows down scientific process, and makes the research and educational environment non-transparent. Thus, there is an urgent need to formulate a state open science policy in Ukraine, which will ensure the strengthening of openness principles, not only as regards public information in the form of open data, but also as regards scientific and educational data. A state open science policy will make it possible for scientists, educators, innovators, industrialists, and other stakeholders to obtain the greatest possible access to research infrastructures, publications, and data; and will create preconditions for ensuring equal opportunities and access for women and men in science. Approval of the National Plan for Open Science will: create regulatory and legal preconditions for formulating the state policy of open science; provide stakeholders with open access to devices, equipment, and other means for achieving scientific results; ensure processing of research data by using FAIR principles; facilitate acceleration of the circulation of scientific information; ensure access to up-to-date scientific information without discrimination (against age, speciality, residence, affiliation with certain institutes, etc.); create preconditions for more effective use of R&D results financed from the state budget (taxpayer money); make the academic and educational dimension more transparent. 14

The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in 2009.In 2013, Ukraine was granted the status of a country implementing the aforementioned Initiative. In accordance with the requirements of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, extractive industries prepared national reports under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative for the period from 2013 to 2017, which are published on the official website of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in Ukraine (http://eiti.org.ua/). In June 2019, at the Global Conference of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a new Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative standard was adopted; the latter specifies the procedure for disclosure of information, and its extent, for the purpose of enhancing transparency and accountability in extractive industries. Starting from 2018, reports under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative must conform with the Law of Ukraine “On Ensuring Transparency in Extractive Industries”. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Resolution No. 858 of 23 September 2020 approved the form of reports on payments to be used by extractive enterprises and recipients of payments, and determined the extent of information to be provided by the information disclosure subjects. Currently, national reports for 2018 and 2019 under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative are being prepared. In December 2020, the Ministry of Energy renewed the composition of the Multi-Stakeholder Group for Implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. In accordance with the Memorandum of Cooperation with the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), an electronic system for submitting and operating the publicly-accessible part of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative’s national portal (online platform) was created. Implementing the electronic system requires a decision to be made to that effect by the Multi-Stakeholder Group for Implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The regulatory and legal framework must also be developed, and the staff of the central executive authorities and extractive enterprises must be trained. Implementing the electronic system for reporting and report analysis under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative will facilitate: growing public awareness of the activities of extractive sector companies and the payments the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has received from such companies; 24 building a constructive dialogue between company representatives, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, and civil society institutions concerning the management of natural resources and the efficient use of mineral resources; the simplification of work involving data collection and analysis, and preparing national reports under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

Moreover, open data is a valuable resource facilitating the country’s economic development, including its digital economy, which is demonstrated by the results of global research. It is expected that the G-20 economies will increase their GDPs by 1.1 percent due to opening priority data sets. The Kyiv School of Economics and the Open Data Institute (UK) have analysed the potential economic impact of open data in Ukraine by using the European Commission’s research methodology. The study revealed that open data has resulted in over USD 700 million in revenue coming into Ukraine. If Ukraine further develops its open data policy, income could grow to USD 1.14 billion, or by 0.92 per cent of GDP, by 2025. However, there is also a significant problem: information administrators lack the knowledge and skills to operate open data in a highquality and effective manner. Moreover, there is low awareness on the part of the public and members of the business community as to the opportunities and ways to use open data. Establishing the National Centre for Open Data Competence will have a positive impact on raising awareness among information administrators and open data users, and will contribute to Ukraine’s rise in international anti-corruption ratings. It is expected that the National Centre for Open Data Competence will: offer knowledge base and training courses for various target audiences; bring together open-data-based services; and, become a platform for communications and the collection of propositions from the public as regards forming the national open data policy. 29 Meeting this obligation will contribute to raising the public information administrators’ awareness as to operations with open data; increasing the involvement of civil society and business representatives in solving problematic issues of using and working with open data; and, popularising the social, economic, and anti-corruption impact of open data.

In 2020, Ukraine also joined the Global Biarritz Partnership for Gender Equality and undertook to develop inclusive and gender-sensitive public spaces friendly to families with children and persons with reduced mobility. In the context of digitalisation of the economy and social relations, and the active introduction of e-governance elements, the Internet is becoming an irreplaceable and safe tool for receiving and providing services and accessing relevant information, communications, and socialisation. But even now, persons with disabilities cannot exercise their rights in full by using the Internet because of low digital accessibility. Persons suffering from various conditions face difficulties when accessing public information and using electronic services, other services, and mobile applications. In pursuance of international commitments on accessibility of public information for persons with disabilities, a number of legal and normative acts have been adopted, but their implementation is complicated by the lack of proper mechanisms for verifying and controlling the accessibility of public information for persons with disabilities. 31 The State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting conducted monitoring on the accessibility of content on executive authority official websites. Based on this research, as of June 2020, 67.69% of central executive authorities and 84% of local executive authorities had fully complied with the requirements of legal and normative acts as regards ensuring accessibility to information for users with impaired vision and hearing. 6.15% of central executive authorities had partially adapted their websites for the needs of persons with impaired vision and hearing. Other executive authorities are only beginning to take measures to upgrade their websites. Consequently, there is a need for specialised software intended to simplify a person with disabilities’ access to Internet resources and to carry out checks for website conformity to the special requirements of DSTU ISO/IEC 40500:2015 “Information technology - W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0”. In view of the above, an actual objective is creating preconditions for: equal access to information for all people, including access to all public information; unimpeded exercise by persons with disabilities of their right to access the Internet; exercise by persons with disabilities of their right to participate in cultural life under electronic governance (making use of national electronic services, other services, and mobile applications). Based on the results of compliance with this obligation, requirements to official electronic resources of public authorities and local selfgoverning bodies (as regards digital accessibility for persons with disabilities) will be updated, and an assessment of the need for software intended to simplify access to the Internet for persons with disabilities will be conducted.

Statistics on key indicators provided by public authorities is mainly broken down by gender. Despite this fact, due to the practices of using different methodologies and different meta-data, such statistics are generally not directly comparable and do not reflect complete or detailed basic information on women's and men's participation in society. The lack of comprehensive gender-disaggregated data in open access precludes planning, managing, and monitoring socio-economic and cultural development processes that takes into account the needs of women and men and existing gender gaps. Accomplishing this task allows citizens, civil society institutions, scientists, and other stakeholders to access gender-disaggregated data, in particular, from the state electronic registers, which will help raise awareness in Ukrainian society about the impact of gender factors on society and on various spheres of social life, the formation of gender gaps, and the opportunities and benefits of addressing gender issues and ensuring equality between women and men.

This affects Ukraine’s acquisition of the status of an EU membership candidate country since the relevant resolution of the European Parliament states that an enhanced and structured political dialog between the European Commission and the EU Council on one side and the candidate country on the other side should be conducted, among other things, with a view to legislation harmonization. Therefore, harmonizing the national legislation with the EU legislation (EU Acquis) is an essential condition for the success of the negotiation process on Ukraine's accession to the EU. In the context of the expected opening of a large-scale negotiation process between Ukraine and the EU, which will cover bringing various spheres of economic, legal, and social life in Ukraine into compliance with EU requirements and standards, there is a need to develop and adopt a strategic document that will cover the key milestones of the adaptation of Ukraine’s legislation to the legislation of the European Union (EU Acquis) and will become a kind of road map for reforming the legislative field as part of Ukraine's progression to EU membership. Based on the experience of EU member states and other EU candidate states, the format of such a strategic document is the National Program for the Adaptation of Ukrainian Legislation to the EU Acquis (hereinafter - the Program). The implementation of the Program involves the establishment of strategic tasks according to the EU accession criteria (Copenhagen criteria of 1993, Madrid criteria of 1995) and 33 negotiation chapters in accordance with the analytical report on the European Commission’s opinion regarding Ukraine's application for membership in the European Union. The strategic tasks of the Program will be aimed at improving the rule-making activities of state authorities, introducing a unified system of planning, coordination, and control of the efforts to implement the EU Acquis, formulating negotiating positions for Ukraine's accession to the EU, and conducting such negotiations. The specification of the strategic tasks of the program will take place through the approval of an appropriate plan of action, which will involve the adoption of new legislative acts or amendments to existing legislation to implement specific acts of the EU Acquis (regulations, directives, etc.). The government will annually audit the implementation of the action plan and make appropriate changes to it as needed. Given the need to adapt the legislation in many areas and the involvement of the executive and legislative branches of government and the public in this process, the best way to approve the Program is to adopt a relevant law of Ukraine. Resolution No. 189 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine ""On the Approval of the Procedure for the Initial Assessment of the Implementation Status of the EU Acquis Acts"" (Ofitsiinyi Visnyk Ukrainy [The Official Bulletin of Ukraine], 2023, No. 28, art. 1558) defines the procedure and requirements for ministries, other central bodies of executive power, and state authorities to conduct the initial assessment of the implementation status of the legislative acts of the European Union (EU Acquis) to make a comprehensive comparative analysis of the legislation of Ukraine and the laws of the European Union (EU Acquis) to identify any inconsistencies that need to be eradicated before the beginning and during the negotiation process on Ukraine's accession to the EU. This will ensure a gradual and coordinated model of adaptation of the national legislation to the European Union (EU) acquis, agreed upon with key stakeholders (state and local self-government authorities, civil society institutions, and international partners) to prepare Ukraine for EU accession. The involvement of international technical assistance projects and strategic advisors will continue to be an important factor in the success of this model. Adopting the Program and its action plan will signal to the EU that Ukraine's intentions to join the EU are systematic through its readiness for legal approximation and compliance with EU standards. Implementing the Program will significantly reform most areas of the national legal framework and facilitate Ukraine's integration into the EU.

governments’ disclosure of the revenues received from each company and for each project, will help make the extractive industries far more transparent and accountable worldwide. Our vision is that by 2020 at the latest all the world’s extractive companies will be required by home country regulations and stock market listing rules, and by host country membership of the EITI, to report their payments to governments by country and by project for every country where they do business and, where applicable, to hold information on their beneficial ownership and consider making it publicly available. The UK aims to ensure that extractives companies’ transparency reports are openly available and accessible, and will explore the most suitable formats and mechanisms for this, including consideration of standard reporting templates. Timescales: The key milestones for this commitment are:
2013
The UK establishes an EITI multi-stakeholder group
The UK government consults on draft transposition legislation for the Accounting Directive
2014
The UK is formally recognised as an EITI candidate country
The UK completes transposition of the Accounting Directive and accompanying guidance
recommends that UK-registered extractive companies publish data in an open and
accessible format
2015
The UK publishes its first EITI report and the multi-stakeholder group will have considered
options to publish it in an open and accessible format
UK legislation comes into force requiring UK-listed and UK registered extractive companies
to publish data under the EU Accounting and Transparency Directives
2016

UK0098,United Kingdom,5,1,GBR,Europe,National,1,2021,2023,2,NA,Open contracting,Centralized Open Contracting Data,"Objective To improve compliance, coverage, and quality of contract publication, from planning to final spend. What is the problem that the commitment will address? The COVID-19 emergency and the aspiration to use contract spend for social policy to, for example, ‘level-up’ or ‘build back better’ have highlighted the importance of public procurement. Public attention to this important government function has increased. As a broad strategic function, public procurement links to issues such as transparency, integrity, fair treatment of suppliers and non-discrimination. Despite previous commitments and some progress, the UK public procurement landscape was fragmented even before the COVID-19 emergency. There were missed opportunities to: ● manage spend ● focus on performance and contract management ● improve outcomes For example, although there is increasing compliance with the requirement to publish contract opportunities and awards on Contracts finder, there are still data gaps and limitations that make it difficult for the public sector, the private sector, civil society organisations and citizens to understand the full pattern of government procurement spend. Bidders have to register on multiple platforms to bid and put in very similar information on each platform. Transparency in public procurement is still inconsistent. There are concerns about disclosures under the Freedom of Information Act, and some commercially sensitive information is redacted. In May 2021, the Queen's Speech announced that new public procurement legislation would be introduced when the parliamentary programme allows. The Declaration on Government Reform - June 2021, said that government proposes to: ● “do better at making our data available to all so that we can be more effectively held to account” ● “do better at monitoring and managing how we spend, encouraging new organisations to provide public services, holding those with whom we contract more rigorously to account, and minimising the risk of fraud, error and waste” ● “ensure all data is as open as possible to public and third parties” The UK government has also renewed its international commitments to transparency in the Carbis Bay G7 Summit Communiqué to strive for “transparent, open, economically efficient, fair and competitive standards for ... procurement”. What the government will do The government proposes to take the following actions: 1. Introduce primary and secondary legislation, supported by a learning and development programme to implement increased transparency in public procurement. 2. Embed transparency by default throughout the commercial lifecycle, from planning through to completion, to include transparency notices, including under framework agreements and dynamic purchasing systems, by introducing transparency notices at these stages: ● planning notices ● tender notices ● award notices ● contract notices ● implementation notices Implement the Open Contracting Data Standard The government will require all contracting authorities to implement the [Open Contracting Data Standard](https://standard.open-contracting.org/) (OCDS), to include data for buyers, suppliers, contracts, spend and performance being held and published in OCDS-compatible, open, non-proprietary reusable formats. Establish a central platform for supplier registration The government will establish a single, central digital platform for supplier registration and other information, to include: ● a requirement that all contracting authorities publish procurement and contracting data throughout the commercial lifecycle to the central platform through links to their own systems or directly, as appropriate. ● public access to all published data online and through APIs. ● plans for extra functionality including but not limited to: registers of suppliers; a register of commercial tools (framework agreements, dynamic purchasing agreements and so on); contract performance data including spend and KPIs, a central debarment list, procurement pipelines, and register of complaints and a register of legal challenges How will the commitment contribute to solving the problem? The public will be more confident in public sector procurement if we embed openness, innovation and transparency into procurement systems. This needs a greater focus on data quality, open reporting, and compliance with rules and guidance. Improving the use and validation of non-proprietary, unique, reusable organisation identifiers will help to provide a view of government business with specific organisations. It will also help identify where these organisations are based and who owns them. Improving compliance with policy requirements and guidance to publish contract documents will help with analysis of how contract terms affect the price and delivery of public services. Working with the community to build analytics tools of Contracts Finder data will help government, private firms and citizens use available data to be more informed about public procurement. Work on contract registers and spend linkage will support a move towards a much more integrated public financial infrastructure, where citizens and government can fully ""follow the money"".

Federal law prohibits retaliation against most government employees and contractors who act as whistleblowers, and those protections were strengthened by recent legislation and Executive action. However, some who work for the Government still have diminished statutory protections. The Government must also ensure that Federal employees know their rights. Therefore, the Administration will:
- Mandate Participation in the Office of Special Counsel Whistleblower Certification Program. To ensure that Federal employees understand their whistleblower rights and how to make protected disclosures, the Administration will require covered agencies to complete the U.S. Office of Special Counsel’s program to certify compliance with the Whistleblower Protection Act’s notification requirements.
-Implement the Presidential Directive on Protecting Whistleblowers. The U.S. Government will continue to work to implement the President’s October 2012 Policy Directive on Protecting Whistleblowers with Access to Classified Information (PPD-19), including by ensuring strong, independent due process procedures; awareness of protections; and agency understanding of the protections available to government contractors under the directive.
- Advocate for Legislation to Expand Whistleblower Protections. With the Administration’s support, Congress recently enacted legislation to strengthen whistleblower protections for most Federal Government employees and contractors, but there are still gaps in statutory protections available to certain government employees and contractors. The Administration will continue to work with Congress to enact appropriate legislation to protect these individuals.

New Commitment.
Theme: Access to Public Information
Commitment description
What is the commitment? To draft a proposal to reform Law No. 18 381 on the Right of
Access to Public Information through a participatory process.
What is the problem that the
commitment will address?
Ten years after passing this Law, difficulties have been detected by
the UAIP (control body), as well as by the civil society and multiple
sectors of society, which hinder the exercise of the right and are
directly related to the scope of the law, the exceptions and the
institutional design of the control body, and that must be analyzed
in a participatory and consensual manner in order to achieve a
reform proposal that improves the protection and guarantees for
the exercise of the legal right.
How will the commitment
contribute to solving the problem?
By eliminating obstacles detected in the current implementation of
the text of the law in order to improve its scope and application. At
the same time, it would respond to a demand that arises from the
Open Government process in Uruguay, through the mechanism of
round-table discussions.
OGP value to which this
commitment will contribute.
The commitment contributes to transparency, allowing a better and
more effective exercise of the Right of Access to Public
Information, contributing in turn to Citizen Participation, considering
that the proposal will be carried out in a participatory and
consensual manner.
Additional Information
Equal participation will be promoted in round-table discussions and integration of the gender
perspective in the reform proposal that is drafted.
